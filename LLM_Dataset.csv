Sonnet 12: When I do count the clock that tells the time,"When I do count the clock that tells the time, And see the brave day sunk in hideous night; When I behold the violet past prime, And sable curls all silver’d o’er with white;When lofty trees I see barren of leaves Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, Then of thy beauty do I question make, That thou among the wastes of time must go,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsakeAnd die as fast as they see others grow;    And nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defence   Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.",William Shakespeare,Fear
"Speech: “Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more”","(from Henry V, spoken by King Henry)Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead. In peace there's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility: But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage; Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; Let pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it As fearfully as doth a galled rock O'erhang and jutty his confounded base, Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height. On, on, you noblest English. Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof! Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument: Dishonour not your mothers; now attest That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you. Be copy now to men of grosser blood, And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture; let us swear That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not; For there is none of you so mean and base, That hath not noble lustre in your eyes. I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, Straining upon the start. The game's afoot: Follow your spirit, and upon this charge Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'",William Shakespeare,Joy
"Song: “Take, oh take those lips away”","(from Measure for Measure)Take, oh take those lips away,       That so sweetly were forsworn, And those eyes: the breake of day,       Lights that do mislead the Morn; But my kisses bring again, bring again, Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.",William Shakespeare,Sadness
Song: “Who is Silvia? what is she”,"(from Two Gentlemen of Verona)Who is Silvia? what is she,     That all our swains commend her? Holy, fair, and wise is she;     The heaven such grace did lend her, That she might admirèd be. Is she kind as she is fair?     For beauty lives with kindness. Love doth to her eyes repair,     To help him of his blindness; And, being helped, inhabits there. Then to Silvia let us sing,     That Silvia is excelling; She excels each mortal thing     Upon the dull earth dwelling;  To her let us garlands bring",William Shakespeare,Sadness
Speech: “The raven himself is hoarse”,"(from Macbeth, spoken by Lady Macbeth)The raven himself is hoarseThat croaks the fatal entrance of DuncanUnder my battlements. Come, you spiritsThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top-fullOf direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,Stop up th' access and passage to remorse,That no compunctious visitings of natureShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace betweenThe effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers,Wherever in your sightless substancesYou wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,To cry ""Hold, hold!""",William Shakespeare,Fear
Speech: Bottom's Dream,"(from A Midsummer Night's Dream, spoken by Bottom)When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is “Most fair Pyramus.” Heigh-ho! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-mender? Snout the tinker? Starveling? God’s my life, stol'n hence, and left me asleep? I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream—past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom. And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.",William Shakespeare,Surprise
"Sonnet 123: No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change","No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:Thy pyramids built up with newer mightTo me are nothing novel, nothing strange;They are but dressings of a former sight.Our dates are brief, and therefore we admireWhat thou dost foist upon us that is old,And rather make them born to our desireThan think that we before have heard them told.Thy registers and thee I both defy,Not wondering at the present nor the past;For thy records and what we see doth lie,Made more or less by that continual haste.   This I do vow, and this shall ever be:   I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.",William Shakespeare,Fear
Sonnet 125: Were’t aught to me I bore the canopy,"Were’t aught to me I bore the canopy,With my extern the outward honouring,Or laid great bases for eternity,Which proves more short than waste or ruining;Have I not seen dwellers on form and favourLose all, and more, by paying too much rent,For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?No;—let me be obsequious in thy heart,And take thou my oblation, poor but free,Which is not mix’d with seconds, knows no art,But mutual render, only me for thee.   Hence, thou suborn’d informer! a true soul,   When most impeach’d, stands least in thy control.",William Shakespeare,Sadness
Speech: “Is this a dagger which I see before me”,"(from Macbeth, spoken by Macbeth)Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw. Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going; And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before. There's no such thing: It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder, Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace. With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives: Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.                                     [a bell rings] I go, and it is done; the bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell.",William Shakespeare,Sadness

Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.",William Shakespeare,Love
Sonnet 34: Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,And make me travel forth without my cloak,To let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?‘Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,For no man well of such a salve can speakThat heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:The offender’s sorrow lends but weak reliefTo him that bears the strong offence’s cross.   Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,   And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.",William Shakespeare,Sadness
"Sonnet 53: What is your substance, whereof are you made","What is your substance, whereof are you made,That millions of strange shadows on you tend?Since every one hath, every one, one shade,And you, but one, can every shadow lend.Describe Adonis, and the counterfeitIs poorly imitated after you;On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,And you in Grecian tires are painted new.Speak of the spring and foison of the year:The one doth shadow of your beauty show,The other as your bounty doth appear;And you in every blessèd shape we know.    In all external grace you have some part,    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.",William Shakespeare,Joy
Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?,"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate:Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;And every fair from fair sometime declines,By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;But thy eternal summer shall not fade,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",William Shakespeare,Joy

Song: “Orpheus with his lute made trees”,"(from Henry VIII)Orpheus with his lute made trees, And the mountain tops that freeze, Bow themselves when he did sing:To his music plants and flowers Ever sprung; as sun and showers There had made a lasting spring.

Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom.

Three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride, Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen, Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned, Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green. Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand, Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived; So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived: For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred: Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.",William Shakespeare,Love

Take the instant way;For honour travels in a strait so narrow,Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;For emulation hath a thousand sonsThat one by one pursue: if you give way,Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush byAnd leave you hindmost;Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours; For time is like a fashionable hostThat slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seekRemuneration for the thing it was;For beauty, wit,High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all To envious and calumniating time.One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,Though they are made and moulded of things past,And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.The present eye praises the present object.Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,And still it might, and yet it may again,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself aliveAnd case thy reputation in thy tent;Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late, Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselvesAnd drave great Mars to faction.",William Shakespeare,Joy

Annabel Lee,"It was many and many a year ago,    In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know    By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought    Than to love and be loved by me. I was a child and she was a child,    In this kingdom by the sea, But we loved with a love that was more than love—    I and my Annabel Lee— With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven    Coveted her and me. And this was the reason that, long ago,    In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling    My beautiful Annabel Lee; So that her highborn kinsmen came    And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre    In this kingdom by the sea. The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,    Went envying her and me— Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,    In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud by night,    Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. But our love it was stronger by far than the love    Of those who were older than we—    Of many far wiser than we— And neither the angels in Heaven above    Nor the demons down under the sea Can ever dissever my soul from the soul    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side    Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,    In her sepulchre there by the sea—    In her tomb by the sounding sea.",Edgar Allan Poe,Love

Dream-Land,"By a route obscure and lonely,   Haunted by ill angels only, Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   On a black throne reigns upright, I have reached these lands but newly   From an ultimate dim Thule— From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,        Out of SPACE—Out of TIME. Bottomless vales and boundless floods,   And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,   With forms that no man can discover   For the tears that drip all over;   Mountains toppling evermore   Into seas without a shore;   Seas that restlessly aspire,   Surging, unto skies of fire;   Lakes that endlessly outspread   Their lone waters—lone and dead,—   Their still waters—still and chilly   With the snows of the lolling lily.

For the heart whose woes are legion   ’T is a peaceful, soothing region—   For the spirit that walks in shadow   ’T is—oh, ’t is an Eldorado! But the traveller, travelling through it,   May not—dare not openly view it;   Never its mysteries are exposed   To the weak human eye unclosed;   So wills its King, who hath forbid   The uplifting of the fring'd lid;   And thus the sad Soul that here passes   Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

Merrily live, and long!The ecstasies above   With thy burning measures suit—   Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,   With the fervour of thy lute—   Well may the stars be mute!Yes, Heaven is thine; but this   Is a world of sweets and sours;   Our flowers are merely—flowers,   And the shadow of thy perfect bliss   Is the sunshine of ours.If I could dwellWhere Israfel   Hath dwelt, and he where I,He might not sing so wildly well   A mortal melody,While a bolder note than this might swell      From my lyre within the sky.",Edgar Allan Poe,Surprise
A Dream Within a Dream,"Take this kiss upon the brow!And, in parting from you now,Thus much let me avow —You are not wrong, who deemThat my days have been a dream;Yet if hope has flown awayIn a night, or in a day,In a vision, or in none,Is it therefore the less gone?  All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream.I stand amid the roarOf a surf-tormented shore,And I hold within my handGrains of the golden sand —How few! yet how they creepThrough my fingers to the deep,While I weep — while I weep!O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp?O God! can I not saveOne from the pitiless wave?Is all that we see or seemBut a dream within a dream?",Edgar Allan Poe,Fear
Fairy-Land,"Dim vales—and shadowy floods— And cloudy-looking woods, Whose forms we can’t discover For the tears that drip all over: Huge moons there wax and wane— Again—again—again— Every moment of the night— Forever changing places— And they put out the star-light With the breath from their pale faces. About twelve by the moon-dial, One more filmy than the rest (A kind which, upon trial, They have found to be the best) Comes down—still down—and down With its centre on the crown Of a mountain’s eminence, While its wide circumference In easy drapery falls Over hamlets, over halls, Wherever they may be— O’er the strange woods—o’er the sea— Over spirits on the wing— Over every drowsy thing— And buries them up quite In a labyrinth of light— And then, how, deep! —O, deep, Is the passion of their sleep. In the morning they arise, And their moony covering Is soaring in the skies, With the tempests as they toss, Like—almost any thing— Or a yellow Albatross. They use that moon no more For the same end as before, Videlicet, a tent— Which I think extravagant: Its atomies, however, Into a shower dissever, Of which those butterflies Of Earth, who seek the skies, And so come down again (Never-contented things!) Have brought a specimen Upon their quivering wings.",Edgar Allan Poe,Fear
To My Mother,"Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,The angels, whispering to one another,Can find, among their burning terms of love,None so devotional as that of “Mother,”Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—You who are more than mother unto me,And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed youIn setting my Virginia's spirit free.My mother—my own mother, who died early,Was but the mother of myself; but youAre mother to the one I loved so dearly,And thus are dearer than the mother I knewBy that infinity with which my wifeWas dearer to my soul than its soul-life.",Edgar Allan Poe,Love
The Raven,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—            Only this and nothing more.”    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—            Nameless here for evermore.    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtainThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—            This it is and nothing more.”    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—            Darkness there and nothing more.    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—            Merely this and nothing more.    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,            With such name as “Nevermore.”    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke onlyThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressingTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,            She shall press, ah, nevermore!    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censerSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sittingOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor            Shall be lifted—nevermore!",Edgar Allan Poe,Sadness
The Conqueror Worm,"Lo! ’t is a gala night    Within the lonesome latter years!   An angel throng, bewinged, bedight    In veils, and drowned in tears,   Sit in a theatre, to see    A play of hopes and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully      The music of the spheres. Mimes, in the form of God on high,      Mutter and mumble low, And hither and thither fly—    Mere puppets they, who come and go   At bidding of vast formless things    That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings    Invisible Wo! That motley drama—oh, be sure      It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom chased for evermore      By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in      To the self-same spot, And much of Madness, and more of Sin,      And Horror the soul of the plot. But see, amid the mimic rout,    A crawling shape intrude! A blood-red thing that writhes from out      The scenic solitude! It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs   The mimes become its food, And seraphs sob at vermin fangs    In human gore imbued. Out—out are the lights—out all!      And, over each quivering form, The curtain, a funeral pall,    Comes down with the rush of a storm,   While the angels, all pallid and wan,      Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”      And its hero, the Conqueror Worm.",Edgar Allan Poe,Fear
The Valley of Unrest,"Once it smiled a silent dell Where the people did not dwell; They had gone unto the wars, Trusting to the mild-eyed stars, Nightly, from their azure towers, To keep watch above the flowers, In the midst of which all day The red sun-light lazily lay. Now each visitor shall confess The sad valley’s restlessness. Nothing there is motionless— Nothing save the airs that brood Over the magic solitude. Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees That palpitate like the chill seas Around the misty Hebrides! Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven That rustle through the unquiet Heaven Uneasily, from morn till even, Over the violets there that lie In myriad types of the human eye— Over the lilies there that wave And weep above a nameless grave! They wave:—from out their fragrant tops External dews come down in drops. They weep:—from off their delicate stems Perennial tears descend in gems.",Edgar Allan Poe,Sadness
To -- -- --. Ulalume: A Ballad,"The skies they were ashen and sober;       The leaves they were crispéd and sere—       The leaves they were withering and sere; It was night in the lonesome October       Of my most immemorial year; It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,       In the misty mid region of Weir— It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,       In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. Here once, through an alley Titanic,       Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—       Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul. These were days when my heart was volcanic       As the scoriac rivers that roll—       As the lavas that restlessly roll Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek       In the ultimate climes of the pole— That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek       In the realms of the boreal pole. Our talk had been serious and sober,       But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—       Our memories were treacherous and sere— For we knew not the month was October,       And we marked not the night of the year—       (Ah, night of all nights in the year!) We noted not the dim lake of Auber—       (Though once we had journeyed down here)— We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,       Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. And now, as the night was senescent       And star-dials pointed to morn—       As the star-dials hinted of morn— At the end of our path a liquescent       And nebulous lustre was born, Out of which a miraculous crescent       Arose with a duplicate horn— Astarte's bediamonded crescent       Distinct with its duplicate horn. And I said—""She is warmer than Dian:       She rolls through an ether of sighs—       She revels in a region of sighs: She has seen that the tears are not dry on       These cheeks, where the worm never dies, And has come past the stars of the Lion       To point us the path to the skies—       To the Lethean peace of the skies— Come up, in despite of the Lion,       To shine on us with her bright eyes— Come up through the lair of the Lion,       With love in her luminous eyes."" But Psyche, uplifting her finger,       Said—""Sadly this star I mistrust—       Her pallor I strangely mistrust:— Oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger!       Oh, fly!—let us fly!—for we must."" In terror she spoke, letting sink her       Wings till they trailed in the dust— In agony sobbed, letting sink her       Plumes till they trailed in the dust—       Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust. I replied—""This is nothing but dreaming:       Let us on by this tremulous light!       Let us bathe in this crystalline light! Its Sybilic splendor is beaming       With Hope and in Beauty to-night:—       See!—it flickers up the sky through the night! Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,       And be sure it will lead us aright— We safely may trust to a gleaming       That cannot but guide us aright,       Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night."" Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,       And tempted her out of her gloom—       And conquered her scruples and gloom: And we passed to the end of the vista,       But were stopped by the door of a tomb—       By the door of a legended tomb; And I said—""What is written, sweet sister,       On the door of this legended tomb?""       She replied—""Ulalume—Ulalume—       'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"" Then my heart it grew ashen and sober       As the leaves that were crispèd and sere—       As the leaves that were withering and sere, And I cried—""It was surely October       On this very night of last year       That I journeyed—I journeyed down here—       That I brought a dread burden down here—       On this night of all nights in the year,       Oh, what demon has tempted me here? Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—       This misty mid region of Weir— Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber—       In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."" Said we, then—the two, then—""Ah, can it       Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—       The pitiful, the merciful ghouls— To bar up our way and to ban it       From the secret that lies in these wolds—       From the thing that lies hidden in these wolds— Had drawn up the spectre of a planet       From the limbo of lunary souls— This sinfully scintillant planet       From the Hell of the planetary souls?""",Edgar Allan Poe,Fear

Grief,"I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;  That only men incredulous of despair,  Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air  Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access  Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,  In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare  Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare  Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express  Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—  Most like a monumental statue set  In everlasting watch and moveless woe  Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.  Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:  If it could weep, it could arise and go.",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Fear

The cup of dole God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink, And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.

I love thee to the level of every day’s Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as men strive for right; I love thee purely, as they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.Poetry Out Loud Note: In the print anthology, this poem is titled simply ""How do I love thee?

"from Aurora Leigh, First Book","In those days, though, I never analysedMyself even. All analysis comes late.You catch a sight of Nature, earliest,In full front sun-face, and your eyelids winkAnd drop before the wonder of ‘t; you missThe form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days,And wrote because I lived–unlicensed else:My heart beat in my brain. Life’s violent floodAbolished bounds,–and, which my neighbour’s field,Which mine, what mattered? It is so in youth.We play at leap-frog over the god Term;The love within us and the love withoutAre mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love,We scarce distinguish. So, with other power.Being acted on and acting seem the same:In that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels,We know not if the forests move or we.And so, like most young poets, in a flushOf individual life, I poured myselfAlong the veins of others, and achievedMere lifeless imitations of life verse,And made the living answer for the dead,Profaning nature. ‘Touch not, do not taste,Nor handle,’–we’re too legal, who write young:We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs,As if still ignorant of counterpoint;We call the Muse ... ‘O Muse, benignant Muse!’–As if we had seen her purple-braided head.With the eyes in it start between the boughsAs often as a stag’s. What make-believe,With so much earnest! what effete results,From virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odesFrom such white heats!–bucolics, where the cowsWould scare the writer if they splashed the mudIn lashing off the flies,–didactics, drivenAgainst the heels of what the master said;And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumpsA babe might blow between two straining cheeksOf bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh;And elegiac griefs, and songs of love,Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road,The worse for being warm: all these things, writOn happy mornings, with a morning heart,That leaps for love, is active for resolve,Weak for art only. Oft, the ancient formsWill thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood.The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped,Will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in.Spare the old bottles!–spill not the new wine.By Keats’s soul, the man who never steppedIn gradual progress like another man,But, turning grandly on his central self,Ensphered himself in twenty perfect yearsAnd died, not young,–(the life of a long life,Distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tearUpon the world’s cold cheek to make it burnFor ever;) by that strong excepted soul,I count it strange, and hard to understand,That nearly all young poets should write old;That Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen,And beardless Byron academical,And so with others. It may be, perhaps,Such have not settled long and deep enoughIn trance, to attain to clairvoyance,–and stillThe memory mixes with the vision, spoils,And works it turbid.                  Or perhaps, again,In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx,The melancholy desert must sweep round,Behind you, as before.–For me, I wroteFalse poems, like the rest, and thought them true.Because myself was true in writing them.I, peradventure, have writ true ones sinceWith less complacence.                    But I could not hideMy quickening inner life from those at watch.They saw a light at a window now and then,They had not set there. Who had set it there?My father’s sister started when she caughtMy soul agaze in my eyes. She could not sayI had no business with a sort of soul,But plainly she objected,–and demurred,That souls were dangerous things to carry straightThrough all the spilt saltpetre of the world.She said sometimes, ‘Aurora, have you doneYour task this morning?–have you read that book?And are you ready for the crochet here?’–As if she said, ‘I know there’s something wrong,I know I have not ground you down enoughTo flatten and bake you to a wholesome crustFor household uses and proprieties,Before the rain has got into my barnAnd set the grains a-sprouting. What, you’re greenWith out-door impudence? you almost grow?’To which I answered, ‘Would she hear my task,And verify my abstract of the book?And should I sit down to the crochet work?Was such her pleasure?’ ... Then I sate and teasedThe patient needle til it split the thread,Which oozed off from it in meandering laceFrom hour to hour. I was not, therefore, sad;My soul was singing at a work apartBehind the wall of sense, as safe from harmAs sings the lark when sucked up out of sight,In vortices of glory and blue air.And so, through forced work and spontaneous work,The inner life informed the outer life,Reduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms,Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams,And, rounding to the spheric soul the thinPined body, struck a colour up the cheeks,Though somewhat faint. I clenched my brows acrossMy blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass,And said, ‘We’ll live, Aurora! we’ll be strong.The dogs are on us–but we will not die.’",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Anger

A Musical Instrument,"I. WHAT was he doing, the great god Pan,     Down in the reeds by the river ? Spreading ruin and scattering ban, Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, And breaking the golden lilies afloat     With the dragon-fly on the river. II. He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,     From the deep cool bed of the river : The limpid water turbidly ran, And the broken lilies a-dying lay, And the dragon-fly had fled away,     Ere he brought it out of the river. III. High on the shore sate the great god Pan,     While turbidly flowed the river ; And hacked and hewed as a great god can, With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed, Till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed     To prove it fresh from the river. IV. He cut it short, did the great god Pan,     (How tall it stood in the river !) Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man, Steadily from the outside ring, And notched the poor dry empty thing     In holes, as he sate by the river. V.  This is the way,' laughed the great god Pan,     Laughed while he sate by the river,)  The only way, since gods began To make sweet music, they could succeed.' Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,     He blew in power by the river. VI. Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan !     Piercing sweet by the river ! Blinding sweet, O great god Pan ! The sun on the hill forgot to die, And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly     Came back to dream on the river. VII. Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,     To laugh as he sits by the river, Making a poet out of a man : The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, — For the reed which grows nevermore again     As a reed with the reeds in the river.",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Fear
The Cry of the Children,"""Pheu pheu, ti prosderkesthe m ommasin, tekna;"" [[Alas, alas, why do you gaze at me with your eyes, my children.]]—Medea.Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,       Ere the sorrow comes with years ? They are leaning their young heads against their mothers, —       And that cannot stop their tears. The young lambs are bleating in the meadows ;    The young birds are chirping in the nest ; The young fawns are playing with the shadows ;    The young flowers are blowing toward the west— But the young, young children, O my brothers,       They are weeping bitterly ! They are weeping in the playtime of the others,       In the country of the free. Do you question the young children in the sorrow,       Why their tears are falling so ? The old man may weep for his to-morrow       Which is lost in Long Ago — The old tree is leafless in the forest —    The old year is ending in the frost — The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest —    The old hope is hardest to be lost : But the young, young children, O my brothers,       Do you ask them why they stand Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,       In our happy Fatherland ? They look up with their pale and sunken faces,       And their looks are sad to see, For the man's grief abhorrent, draws and presses       Down the cheeks of infancy — ""Your old earth,"" they say, ""is very dreary;""    ""Our young feet,"" they say, ""are very weak !"" Few paces have we taken, yet are weary—    Our grave-rest is very far to seek ! Ask the old why they weep, and not the children,       For the outside earth is cold — And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,       And the graves are for the old !"" ""True,"" say the children, ""it may happen       That we die before our time ! Little Alice died last year her grave is shapen       Like a snowball, in the rime. We looked into the pit prepared to take her —    Was no room for any work in the close clay : From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,    Crying, 'Get up, little Alice ! it is day.' If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower,    With your ear down, little Alice never cries ; Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,    For the smile has time for growing in her eyes ,— And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in       The shroud, by the kirk-chime ! It is good when it happens,"" say the children,       ""That we die before our time !"" Alas, the wretched children ! they are seeking       Death in life, as best to have ! They are binding up their hearts away from breaking,       With a cerement from the grave. Go out, children, from the mine and from the city —    Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do — Pluck you handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty    Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through ! But they answer, "" Are your cowslips of the meadows       Like our weeds anear the mine ? Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows,       From your pleasures fair and fine! ""For oh,"" say the children, ""we are weary,       And we cannot run or leap — If we cared for any meadows, it were merely       To drop down in them and sleep. Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping —    We fall upon our faces, trying to go ; And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,    The reddest flower would look as pale as snow. For, all day, we drag our burden tiring,       Through the coal-dark, underground — Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron       In the factories, round and round. ""For all day, the wheels are droning, turning, —       Their wind comes in our faces, — Till our hearts turn, — our heads, with pulses burning,       And the walls turn in their places Turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling —    Turns the long light that droppeth down the wall, — Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling —    All are turning, all the day, and we with all ! — And all day, the iron wheels are droning ;       And sometimes we could pray, 'O ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning)       'Stop ! be silent for to-day ! ' "" Ay ! be silent ! Let them hear each other breathing       For a moment, mouth to mouth — Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing       Of their tender human youth ! Let them feel that this cold metallic motion    Is not all the life God fashions or reveals — Let them prove their inward souls against the notion    That they live in you, or under you, O wheels ! — Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,       As if Fate in each were stark ; And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,       Spin on blindly in the dark. Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,       To look up to Him and pray — So the blessed One, who blesseth all the others,       Will bless them another day. They answer, "" Who is God that He should hear us,    While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred ? When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us    Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word ! And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)       Strangers speaking at the door : Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him,       Hears our weeping any more ? "" Two words, indeed, of praying we remember ;       And at midnight's hour of harm, — 'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,       We say softly for a charm. We know no other words, except 'Our Father,'    And we think that, in some pause of angels' song, God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,    And hold both within His right hand which is strong. 'Our Father !' If He heard us, He would surely       (For they call Him good and mild) Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,       'Come and rest with me, my child.' ""But, no !"" say the children, weeping faster,       "" He is speechless as a stone ; And they tell us, of His image is the master       Who commands us to work on. Go to ! "" say the children,—""up in Heaven,    Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find ! Do not mock us ; grief has made us unbelieving —    We look up for God, but tears have made us blind."" Do ye hear the children weeping and disproving,       O my brothers, what ye preach ? For God's possible is taught by His world's loving —       And the children doubt of each. And well may the children weep before you ;       They are weary ere they run ; They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory       Which is brighter than the sun : They know the grief of man, without its wisdom ;    They sink in the despair, without its calm — Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom, —    Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm, — Are worn, as if with age, yet unretrievingly       No dear remembrance keep,— Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly :       Let them weep ! let them weep ! They look up, with their pale and sunken faces,       And their look is dread to see, For they think you see their angels in their places,       With eyes meant for Deity ;— ""How long,"" they say, ""how long, O cruel nation,    Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart, — Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,    And tread onward to your throne amid the mart ? Our blood splashes upward, O our tyrants,       And your purple shews your path ; But the child's sob curseth deeper in the silence       Than the strong man in his wrath !""",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Sadness
"Sonnets from the Portuguese 20: Beloved, my Beloved, when I think","Beloved, my Beloved, when I think That thou wast in the world a year ago, What time I sate alone here in the snow And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink No moment at thy voice ... but, link by link, Went counting all my chains, as if that so They never could fall off at any blow Struck by thy possible hand ... why, thus I drink Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful, Never to feel thee thrill the day or night With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white Thou sawest growing!

Mother and Poet,"I. Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east,  And one of them shot in the west by the sea.Dead ! both my boys ! When you sit at the feast  And are wanting a great song for Italy free,     Let none look at me ! II. Yet I was a poetess only last year,  And good at my art, for a woman, men said ;But this woman, this, who is agonized here,  — The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head     For ever instead.III. What art can a woman be good at ? Oh, vain !  What art is she good at, but hurting her breastWith the milk-teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain ?  Ah boys, how you hurt ! you were strong as you pressed,     And I proud, by that test.IV. What art's for a woman ? To hold on her knees  Both darlings ! to feel all their arms round her throat,Cling, strangle a little ! to sew by degrees  And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat ;     To dream and to doat.V. To teach them ... It stings there ! I made them indeed  Speak plain the word country. I taught them, no doubt,That a country's a thing men should die for at need.I prated of liberty, rights, and about     The tyrant cast out.VI. And when their eyes flashed ... O my beautiful eyes ! ...I exulted ; nay, let them go forth at the wheelsOf the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise  When one sits quite alone ! Then one weeps, then one kneels !     God, how the house feels !VII. At first, happy news came, in gay letters moiled  With my kisses, — of camp-life and glory, and howThey both loved me ; and, soon coming home to be spoiled  In return would fan off every fly from my brow     With their green laurel-bough.VIII. Then was triumph at Turin : Ancona was free !'  And some one came out of the cheers in the street,With a face pale as stone, to say something to me.  My Guido was dead ! I fell down at his feet,     While they cheered in the street.IX. I bore it ; friends soothed me ; my grief looked sublime  As the ransom of Italy. One boy remainedTo be leant on and walked with, recalling the time  When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained     To the height he had gained.X. And letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong,  Writ now but in one hand, I was not to faint, —One loved me for two — would be with me ere long :  And Viva l' Italia ! — he died for, our saint,     Who forbids our complaint.""XI. My Nanni would add, he was safe, and aware  Of a presence that turned off the balls, — was imprestIt was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,  And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed,     To live on for the rest.""XII. On which, without pause, up the telegraph line  Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta : — Shot.Tell his mother. Ah, ah,  his, '  their ' mother, — not  mine, '  No voice says ""My mother"" again to me. What !     You think Guido forgot ?XIII. Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,  They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe ?I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven  Through THAT Love and Sorrow which reconciled so     The Above and Below.XIV. O Christ of the five wounds, who look'dst through the dark  To the face of Thy mother ! consider, I pray,How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,  Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away,     And no last word to say !XV. Both boys dead ? but that's out of nature. We all  Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one.'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to a wall ;  And, when Italy 's made, for what end is it done     If we have not a son ?XVI. Ah, ah, ah ! when Gaeta's taken, what then ?  When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sportOf the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men ?  When the guns of Cavalli with final retort     Have cut the game short ?XVII. When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,  When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red,When you have your country from mountain to sea,  When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,     (And I have my Dead) —XVIII. What then ? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low,  And burn your lights faintly ! My country is there,Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow :  My Italy 's THERE, with my brave civic Pair,     To disfranchise despair !XIX. Forgive me. Some women bear children in strength,  And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn ;But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length  Into wail such as this — and we sit on forlorn     When the man-child is born.XX. Dead ! One of them shot by the sea in the east,  And one of them shot in the west by the sea.Both ! both my boys !

Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change? That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried, To conquer grief, tries more ... as all things prove; For grief indeed is love and grief beside. Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love. Yet love me—wilt thou?

My Heart and I,"I. ENOUGH ! we're tired, my heart and I.

You see we're tired, my heart and I.  We dealt with books, we trusted men,  And in our own blood drenched the pen,As if such colours could not fly.  We walked too straight for fortune's end,  We loved too true to keep a friend ;At last we're tired, my heart and I.III. How tired we feel, my heart and I !  We seem of no use in the world ;  Our fancies hang grey and uncurledAbout men's eyes indifferently ;  Our voice which thrilled you so, will let  You sleep; our tears are only wet :What do we here, my heart and I ?IV. So tired, so tired, my heart and I !  It was not thus in that old time  When Ralph sat with me 'neath the limeTo watch the sunset from the sky.  Dear love, you're looking tired,' he said;  I, smiling at him, shook my head :'Tis now we're tired, my heart and I.V. So tired, so tired, my heart and I !  Though now none takes me on his arm  To fold me close and kiss me warmTill each quick breath end in a sigh  Of happy languor. Now, alone,  We lean upon this graveyard stone,Uncheered, unkissed, my heart and I.VI. Tired out we are, my heart and I.  Suppose the world brought diadems  To tempt us, crusted with loose gemsOf powers and pleasures ? Let it try.  We scarcely care to look at even  A pretty child, or God's blue heaven,We feel so tired, my heart and I.VII. Yet who complains ? My heart and I ?

Then THOU didst come ... to be, Belovèd, what they seemed.

"from Aurora Leigh, Third Book","Why what a pettish, petty thing I grow,–A mere, mere woman,–a mere flaccid nerve,-A kerchief left out all night in the rain,Turned soft so,–overtasked and overstrainedAnd overlived in this close London life!And yet I should be stronger.

"from Aurora Leigh, Second Book","There it is!–You play beside a death-bed like a child,Yet measure to yourself a prophet's placeTo teach the living. None of all these things,Can women understand. You generalise,Oh, nothing!–not even grief! Your quick-breathed hearts,So sympathetic to the personal pang,Close on each separate knife-stroke, yielding upA whole life at each wound; incapableOf deepening, widening a large lap of lifeTo hold the world-full woe. The human raceTo you means, such a child, or such a man,You saw one morning waiting in the cold,Beside that gate, perhaps. You gather upA few such cases, and, when strong, sometimesWill write of factories and of slaves, as ifYour father were a negro, and your sonA spinner in the mills. All's yours and you,–All, coloured with your blood, or otherwiseJust nothing to you. Why, I call you hardTo general suffering. Here's the world half blindWith intellectual light, half brutalisedWith civilization, having caught the plagueIn silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and westAlong a thousand railroads, mad with painAnd sin too! ... does one woman of you all,(You who weep easily) grow pale to seeThis tiger shake his cage?–does one of youStand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearlsAnd pine and die, because of the great sumOf universal anguish?–Show me a tearWet as Cordelia's, in eyes bright as yours,Because the world is mad? You cannot count,That you should weep for this account, not you!You weep for what you know. A red-haired childSick in a fever, if you touch him once,Though but so little as with a finger-tip,Will set you weeping! but a million sick . .You could as soon weep for the rule of three,Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same worldUncomprehended by you must remainUninfluenced by you. Women as you are,Mere women, personal and passionate,You give us doating mothers, and chaste wives.Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints!We get no Christ from you,–and verilyWe shall not get a poet, in my mind.''With which conclusion you conclude' . .                                    'But this–That you, Aurora, with the large live browAnd steady eyelids, cannot condescendTo play at art, as children play at swords,To show a pretty spirit, chiefly admiredBecause true action is impossible.You never can be satisfied with praiseWhich men give women when they judge a bookNot as mere work, but as mere woman's work,Expressing the comparative respectWhich means the absolute scorn. 'Oh, excellent!'What grace! what facile turns! what fluent sweeps!'What delicate discernment ... almost thought!'The book does honour to the sex, we hold.'Among our female authors we make room'For this fair writer, and congratulate'The country that produces in these times'Such women, competent to ... spell.''                                'Stop there!'I answered–burning through his thread of talkWith a quick flame of emotion,–'You have readMy soul, if not my book, and argue wellI would not condescend ... we will not sayTo such a kind of praise, (a worthless endIs praise of all kinds) but to such a useOf holy art and golden life. I am young,And peradventure weak–you tell me so–Through being a woman. And, for all the rest,Take thanks for justice. I would rather danceAt fairs on tight-rope, till the babies droppedTheir gingerbread for joy,–than shift the typesFor tolerable verse, intolerableTo men who act and suffer. Better far,Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means,Than a sublime art frivolously.'*Then I spoke.'I have not stood long on the strand of life,And these salt waters have had scarcely timeTo creep so high up as to wet my feet.I cannot judge these tides–I shall, perhaps.A woman's always younger than a manAt equal years, because she is disallowedMaturing by the outdoor sun and air,And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk.Ah well, I know you men judge otherwise!You think a woman ripens as a peach,–In the cheeks, chiefly. Pass it to me now;I'm young in age, and younger still, I think,As a woman. But a child may say amenTo a bishop's prayer and see the way it goes;And I, incapable to loose the knotOf social questions, can approve, applaudAugust compassion, christian thoughts that shootBeyond the vulgar white of personal aims.Accept my reverence.'

'Now,' I said, 'may GodBe witness 'twixt us two!' and with the word,Meseemed I floated into a sudden lightAbove his stature,–'am I proved too weakTo stand alone, yet strong enough to bearSuch leaners on my shoulder? poor to think,Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought?Incompetent to sing, as blackbirds can,Yet competent to love, like HIM?'                            I paused:Perhaps I darkened, as the lighthouse willThat turns upon the sea. 'It's always so!Anything does for a wife.'                      'Aurora, dear,And dearly honoured' ... he pressed in at onceWith eager utterance,–'you translate me ill.I do not contradict my thought of youWhich is most reverent, with another thoughtFound less so. If your sex is weak for art,(And I who said so, did but honour youBy using truth in courtship) it is strongFor life and duty. Place your fecund heartIn mine, and let us blossom for the worldThat wants love's colour in the grey of time.With all my talk I can but set you whereYou look down coldly on the arena-heapsOf headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct!The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his wayThrough such a heap of generalised distress,To the individual man with lips and eyes–Much less Aurora. Ah, my sweet, come down,And, hand in hand, we'll go where yours shall touchThese victims, one by one! till one by one,The formless, nameless trunk of every manShall seem to wear a head, with hair you know,And every woman catch your mother's faceTo melt you into passion.'                      'I am a girl,'I answered slowly; 'you do well to nameMy mother's face. Though far too early, alas,God's hand did interpose 'twixt it and me,I know so much of love, as used to shineIn that face and another. Just so much;No more indeed at all. I have not seenSo much love since, I pray you pardon me,As answers even to make a marriage with,In this cold land of England. What you love,Is not a woman, Romney, but a cause:You want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir,–A wife to help your ends ... in her no end!Your cause is noble, your ends excellent,But I, being most unworthy of these and that,Do otherwise conceive of love. Farewell.''Farewell, Aurora, you reject me thus?'He said.        'Why, sir, you are married long ago.You have a wife already whom you love,Your social theory. Bless you both, I say.For my part, I am scarcely meek enoughTo be the handmaid of a lawful spouse.Do I look a Hagar, think you?'                          'So, you jest!''Nay so, I speak in earnest,' I replied.'You treat of marriage too much like, at least,A chief apostle; you would bear with youA wife ... a sister ... shall we speak it out?A sister of charity.'                 'Then, must it beIndeed farewell? And was I so far wrongIn hope and in illusion, when I tookThe woman to be nobler than the man,Yourself the noblest woman,–in the useAnd comprehension of what love is,–love,That generates the likeness of itselfThrough all heroic duties? so far wrongIn saying bluntly, venturing truth on love,'Come, human creature, love and work with me,'–Instead of, 'Lady, thou art wondrous fair,'And, where the Graces walk before, the Muse'Will follow at the lighting of the eyes,'And where the Muse walks, lovers need to creep'Turn round and love me, or I die of love.''With quiet indignation I broke in.'You misconceive the question like a man,Who sees a woman as the complementOf his sex merely. You forget too muchThat every creature, female as the male,Stands single in responsible act and thoughtAs also in birth and death. Whoever saysTo a loyal woman, 'Love and work with me,'Will get fair answers, if the work and loveBeing good themselves, are good for her–the bestShe was born for. Women of a softer mood,Surprised by men when scarcely awake to life,Will sometimes only hear the first word, love,And catch up with it any kind of work,Indifferent, so that dear love go with it:I do not blame such women, though, for love,They pick much oakum; earth's fanatics makeToo frequently heaven's saints. But me, your workIs not the best for,–nor your love the best,Nor able to commend the kind of workFor love's sake merely. Ah, you force me, sir,To be over-bold in speaking of myself,–I, too, have my vocation,–work to do,The heavens and earth have set me, since I changedMy father's face for theirs,–and though your worldWere twice as wretched as you representMost serious work, most necessary work,As any of the economists'. Reform,Make trade a Christian possibility,And individual right no general wrong;Wipe out earth's furrows of the Thine and Mine,And leave one green, for men to play at bowls;With innings for them all! ... what then, indeed,If mortals were not greater by the headThan any of their prosperities? what then,Unless the artist keep up open roadsBetwixt the seen and unseen,–bursting throughThe best of your conventions with his bestThe unspeakable, imaginable bestGod bids him speak, to prove what lies beyondBoth speech and imagination? A starved manExceeds a fat beast: we'll not barter, sir,The beautiful for barley.–And, even so,I hold you will not compass your poor endsOf barley-feeding and material ease,Without a poet's individualismTo work your universal. It takes a soul,To move a body: it takes a high-souled man,To move the masses ... even to a cleaner stye:It takes the ideal, to blow a hair's breadth offThe dust of the actual.–ah, your Fouriers failed,Because not poets enough to understandThat life develops from within.–For me,Perhaps I am not worthy, as you say,Of work like this! ... perhaps a woman's soulAspires, and not creates! yet we aspire,And yet I'll try out your perhapses, sir;And if I fail ... why, burn me up my strawLike other false works–I'll not ask for grace,Your scorn is better, cousin Romney. IWho love my art, would never wish it lowerTo suit my stature. I may love my art,You'll grant that even a woman may love art,Seeing that to waste true love on anything,Is womanly, past question.'",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Love
Actaeon,"The hounds, you know them all by name. You fostered them from purblind whelps At their dam’s teats, and you have come To know the music of their yelps: High-strung Anthee, the brindled bitch, The blue-tick coated Philomel, And freckled Chloe, who would fetch A pretty price if you would sell— All fleet of foot, and swift to scent, Inexorable once on the track, Like angry words you might have meant, But do not mean, and can’t take back. There was a time when you would brag How they would bay and rend apart The hopeless belling from a stag. You falter now for the foundered hart. Desires you nursed of a winter night— Did you know then why you bred them— Whose needling milk-teeth used to bite The master’s hand that leashed and fed them?",A. E. Stallings,Anger
Recitative,"Every night, we couldn’t sleep. Our upstairs neighbors had to keep Dropping something down the hall— A barbell or a bowling ball, And from the window by the bed, Echoing inside my head, Alley cats expended breath In arias of love and death. Dawn again, across the street, Jackhammers began to beat Like hangovers, and you would frown— That well-built house, why tear it down? Noon, the radiator grill Groaned, gave off a lesser chill So that we could take off our coats. The pipes coughed to clear their throats. Our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves, We cherished each our minor griefs To keep them warm until the night, When it was time again to fight; But we were young, did not need much To make us laugh instead, and touch, And could not hear ourselves above The arias of death and love.",A.

"Written on the eve of my 20th high school reunion, which I was not able to attend","For the Briarcliff High School class of 1986Just what I needed, Just when the dreams had almost totally receded, The dreams of roles for which I learned no lines and knew no cues, Dreams of pop quizzes with no pants on and no shoes, Just when I understood I was no longer among Those ephemeral immortals, the gauche and pitiable young, Suddenly come phone calls, messages sift out of the air To ask who will be there: Names I haven't given a thought to in a score (A score!) of years, and names I used to think about but don't much anymore, And those I think of all the time and yet Have lost somehow like keys to doors I've closed, and some I have tried to forget— And some who will never arrive at this date Here in the distant future where we wait Still surprised at how We carry with us the omnipresent and ever-changing now. We wince at what we used to wear, Fashion has made ridiculous the high hubris of our hair. Heartbreak, looked at through the wrong end of distance's glasses, Is trivial, and quickly passes, Its purity embarrasses us, its lust, The way we wept because it was unjust. Why should we travel back, who've come so far— We know who we are. How can we be the same As those quaint ancestors we have left behind, who share our name— Why have we inherited their shame?",A. E. Stallings,Joy
Sublunary,"Mid-sentence, we remembered the eclipse, Arguing home through our scant patch of park Still warm with barrel wine, when none too soon We checked the hour by glancing at the moon, Unphased at first by that old ruined marble Looming like a monument over the hill, So brimmed with light it seemed about to spill, Then, there! We watched the thin edge disappear— The obvious stole over us like awe, That it was our own silhouette we saw, Slow perhaps to us moon-gazing here (Reaching for each other's fingertips) But sweeping like a wing across that stark Alien surface at the speed of dark. The crickets stirred from winter sleep to warble Something out of time, confused and brief, The roosting birds sang out in disbelief, The neighborhood's stray dogs began to bark. And then the moon was gone, and in its place, A dim red planet hung just out of reach, As real as a bitter orange or ripened peach In the penumbra of a tree. At last We rose and strolled at a reflective pace Past the taverna crammed with light and smoke And people drinking, laughing at a joke, Unaware that anything had passed Outside in the night where we delayed Sheltering in the shadow we had made.",A. E. Stallings,Fear
Containment,"So long I have been carrying myself Carefully, carefully, like a small child With too much water in a real glass Clasped in two hands, across a space as vast As living rooms, while gazes watch the waves That start to rile the little inland sea And slap against its cliffs' transparency, Revise and meet, double their amplitude, Harmonizing doubt from many ifs. Distant frowns like clouds begin to brood. Soon there is overbrimming. Soon the child Looks up to find a face to match the scolding, And just as he does, the vessel he was holding Is almost set down safely on the bookshelf.",A. E. Stallings,Joy

Arrowhead Hunting,"The land is full of what was lost. What's hidden Rises to the surface after rain In new-ploughed fields, and fields stubbled again: The clay shards, foot and lip, that heaped the midden, And here and there a blade or flakes of blade, A patient art, knapped from a core of flint, Most broken, few as coins new from the mint, Perfect, shot through time as through a glade. You cannot help but think how they were lost: The quarry, fletched shaft in its flank, the blood Whose trail soon vanished in the antlered wood, Not just the meat, but what the weapon cost— O hapless hunter, though your aim was true— The wounded hart, spooked, fleeting in its fear— And the sharpness honed with longing, year by year Buried deeper, found someday, but not by you.",A.

You have to believeThat you have something impossible up your sleeve,The language of snakes, perhaps, an invisible cloak,An army of ants at your beck, or a lethal joke,The will to do whatever must be done:Marry a monster.

Fear of Happiness,"Looking back, it’s something I’ve always had:As a kid, it was a glass-floored elevatorI crouched at the bottom of, my eyes squinched tight,Or staircase whose gaps I was afraid I’d slip through,Though someone always said I’d be all right—Just don’t look down or See, it’s not so bad(The nothing rising underfoot). Then laterThe high-dive at the pool, the tree-house perch,Ferris wheels, balconies, cliffs, a penthouse view,The merest thought of airplanes.

Two Violins,"One was fire red,   Hand carved and new— The local maker pried the wood From a torn-down church's pew, The Devil's instrument Wrenched from the house of God. It answered merrily and clear Though my fingering was flawed; Bright and sharp as a young wine, They said, but it would mellow, And that I would grow into it. The other one was yellow And nicked down at the chin, A varnish of Baltic amber, A one-piece back of tiger maple And a low, dark timbre. A century old, they said, Its sound will never change. Rich and deep on G and D, Thin on the upper range, And how it came from the Old World Was anybody's guess— Light as an exile's suitcase, A belly of emptiness: That was the one I chose (Not the one of flame)   And teachers would turn in their practiced hands To see whence the sad notes came.",A.

Horn at hip went my love ridingriding the echo downinto the silver dawn. four lean hounds crouched low and smilingthe level meadows ran before. Softer be they than slippered sleepthe lean lithe deerthe fleet flown deer. Four fleet does at a gold valleythe famished arrow sang before. Bow at belt went my love ridingriding the mountain downinto the silver dawn. four lean hounds crouched low and smilingthe sheer peaks ran before. Paler be they than daunting deaththe sleek slim deerthe tall tense deer. Four tall stags at a green mountainthe lucky hunter sang before. All in green went my love ridingon a great horse of goldinto the silver dawn. four lean hounds crouched low and smilingmy heart fell dead before.,E. E. Cummings,Anger

"Song: Sweetest love, I do not go","Sweetest love, I do not go,          For weariness of thee, Nor in hope the world can show          A fitter love for me;                 But since that I Must die at last, 'tis best To use myself in jest          Thus by feign'd deaths to die. Yesternight the sun went hence,          And yet is here today; He hath no desire nor sense,          Nor half so short a way:                 Then fear not me, But believe that I shall make Speedier journeys, since I take          More wings and spurs than he. O how feeble is man's power,          That if good fortune fall, Cannot add another hour,          Nor a lost hour recall!                 But come bad chance, And we join to'it our strength, And we teach it art and length,          Itself o'er us to'advance. When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind,          But sigh'st my soul away; When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,          My life's blood doth decay.                 It cannot be That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st, If in thine my life thou waste,          That art the best of me. Let not thy divining heart          Forethink me any ill; Destiny may take thy part,          And may thy fears fulfil;                 But think that we Are but turn'd aside to sleep; They who one another keep          Alive, ne'er parted be.",John Donne,Fear
The Canonization,"For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me love,          Or chide my palsy, or my gout, My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune flout,          With wealth your state, your mind with arts improve,                 Take you a course, get you a place,                 Observe his honor, or his grace, Or the king's real, or his stampèd face          Contemplate; what you will, approve,          So you will let me love. Alas, alas, who's injured by my love?          What merchant's ships have my sighs drowned? Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?          When did my colds a forward spring remove?                 When did the heats which my veins fill                 Add one more to the plaguy bill? Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still          Litigious men, which quarrels move,          Though she and I do love. Call us what you will, we are made such by love;          Call her one, me another fly, We're tapers too, and at our own cost die,          And we in us find the eagle and the dove.                 The phœnix riddle hath more wit                 By us; we two being one, are it.So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.         We die and rise the same, and prove         Mysterious by this love.We can die by it, if not live by love,         And if unfit for tombs and hearseOur legend be, it will be fit for verse;         And if no piece of chronicle we prove,                We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;                As well a well-wrought urn becomesThe greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,         And by these hymns, all shall approve         Us canonized for Love.And thus invoke us: ""You, whom reverend love         Made one another's hermitage;You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;         Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove                Into the glasses of your eyes                (So made such mirrors, and such spies,That they did all to you epitomize)         Countries, towns, courts: beg from above         A pattern of your love!""",John Donne,Sadness
Elegy V:  His Picture,"Here take my picture; though I bid farewell Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell. 'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more When we are shadows both, than 'twas before. When weather-beaten I come back, my hand Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd, My face and breast of haircloth, and my head With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread, My body'a sack of bones, broken within, And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin; If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then, This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say, ""Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay? Or do they reach his judging mind, that he Should now love less, what he did love to see? That which in him was fair and delicate, Was but the milk which in love's childish state Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.""",John Donne,Anger
The Flea,"Mark but this flea, and mark in this,   How little that which thou deniest me is;   It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;   Thou know’st that this cannot be saidA sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,    Yet this enjoys before it woo,    And pampered swells with one blood made of two,    And this, alas, is more than we would do.Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,Where we almost, nay more than married are.   This flea is you and I, and thisOur marriage bed, and marriage temple is;   Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met,   And cloistered in these living walls of jet.    Though use make you apt to kill me,    Let not to that, self-murder added be,    And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.Cruel and sudden, hast thou sincePurpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?   Wherein could this flea guilty be,Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?   Yet thou triumph’st, and say'st that thou   Find’st not thy self, nor me the weaker now;    ’Tis true; then learn how false, fears be:    Just so much honor, when thou yield’st to me,    Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.",John Donne,Joy
The Indifferent,"I can love both fair and brown, Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays, Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays, Her whom the country formed, and whom the town, Her who believes, and her who tries, Her who still weeps with spongy eyes, And her who is dry cork, and never cries; I can love her, and her, and you, and you, I can love any, so she be not true. Will no other vice content you? Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers? Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others? Or doth a fear that men are true torment you? O we are not, be not you so; Let me, and do you, twenty know. Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go. Must I, who came to travail thorough you, Grow your fixed subject, because you are true? Venus heard me sigh this song, And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore, She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more. She went, examined, and returned ere long, And said, Alas! some two or three Poor heretics in love there be, Which think to ’stablish dangerous constancy. But I have told them, Since you will be true, You shall be true to them who are false to you.",John Donne,Joy
Love's Alchemy,"Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I, Say, where his centric happiness doth lie;          I have lov'd, and got, and told, But should I love, get, tell, till I were old, I should not find that hidden mystery.          Oh, 'tis imposture all! And as no chemic yet th'elixir got,          But glorifies his pregnant pot          If by the way to him befall Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal,          So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,          But get a winter-seeming summer's night. Our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day, Shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay?          Ends love in this, that my man Can be as happy'as I can, if he can Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play?          That loving wretch that swears 'Tis not the bodies marry, but the minds,          Which he in her angelic finds,          Would swear as justly that he hears, In that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres.          Hope not for mind in women; at their best          Sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd.",John Donne,Joy
Break of Day,"‘Tis true, ‘tis day, what though it be? O wilt thou therefore rise from me? Why should we rise because ‘tis light? Did we lie down because ‘twas night? Love, which in spite of darkness brought us hither, Should in despite of light keep us together. Light hath no tongue, but is all eye; If it could speak as well as spy, This were the worst that it could say, That being well I fain would stay, And that I loved my heart and honour so, That I would not from him, that had them, go. Must business thee from hence remove? Oh, that’s the worst disease of love, The poor, the foul, the false, love can Admit, but not the busied man. He which hath business, and makes love, doth do Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo.",John Donne,Love
Air and Angels,"Twice or thrice had I lov'd thee, Before I knew thy face or name; So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be;          Still when, to where thou wert, I came, Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.          But since my soul, whose child love is, Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do,          More subtle than the parent is Love must not be, but take a body too;          And therefore what thou wert, and who,                 I bid Love ask, and now That it assume thy body, I allow, And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow. Whilst thus to ballast love I thought, And so more steadily to have gone, With wares which would sink admiration, I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught;          Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon Is much too much, some fitter must be sought;          For, nor in nothing, nor in things Extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere;          Then, as an angel, face, and wings Of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear,          So thy love may be my love's sphere;                 Just such disparity As is 'twixt air and angels' purity, 'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be.",John Donne,Joy
The Apparition,"When by thy scorn, O murd'ress, I am dead          And that thou think'st thee free From all solicitation from me, Then shall my ghost come to thy bed, And thee, feign'd vestal, in worse arms shall see; Then thy sick taper will begin to wink, And he, whose thou art then, being tir'd before, Will, if thou stir, or pinch to wake him, think          Thou call'st for more, And in false sleep will from thee shrink; And then, poor aspen wretch, neglected thou Bath'd in a cold quicksilver sweat wilt lie          A verier ghost than I. What I will say, I will not tell thee now, Lest that preserve thee; and since my love is spent, I'had rather thou shouldst painfully repent, Than by my threat'nings rest still innocent.",John Donne,Sadness
Woman's Constancy,"Now thou has loved me one whole day, Tomorrow when you leav’st, what wilt thou say? Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow?             Or say that now We are not just those persons which we were? Or, that oaths made in reverential fear Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear? Or, as true deaths true marriages untie, So lovers’ contracts, images of those, Bind but till sleep, death’s image, them unloose?             Or, your own end to justify, For having purposed change and falsehood, you Can have no way but falsehood to be true? Vain lunatic, against these ‘scapes I could             Dispute and conquer, if I would,             Which I abstain to do, For by tomorrow, I may think so too.",John Donne,Sadness
Song: Go and catch a falling star,"Go and catch a falling star,    Get with child a mandrake root,Tell me where all past years are,    Or who cleft the devil's foot,Teach me to hear mermaids singing,Or to keep off envy's stinging,            And find            What windServes to advance an honest mind.If thou be'st born to strange sights,    Things invisible to see,Ride ten thousand days and nights,    Till age snow white hairs on thee,Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,All strange wonders that befell thee,            And swear,            No whereLives a woman true, and fair.If thou find'st one, let me know,    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;Yet do not, I would not go,    Though at next door we might meet;Though she were true, when you met her,And last, till you write your letter,            Yet she            Will beFalse, ere I come, to two, or three.Poetry Out Loud Note: In the print anthology, this poem is titled simply ""Song.""

The Dream,"Dear love, for nothing less than thee Would I have broke this happy dream;             It was a theme For reason, much too strong for fantasy, Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it. Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice To make dreams truths, and fables histories; Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best, Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.    As lightning, or a taper's light, Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;             Yet I thought thee (For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight; But when I saw thou sawest my heart, And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art, When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then, I must confess, it could not choose but be Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.    Coming and staying show'd thee, thee, But rising makes me doubt, that now             Thou art not thou. That love is weak where fear's as strong as he; 'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave, If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have; Perchance as torches, which must ready be, Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me; Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I Will dream that hope again, but else would die.",John Donne,Joy
The Ecstasy,"Where, like a pillow on a bed          A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest The violet's reclining head,          Sat we two, one another's best. Our hands were firmly cemented          With a fast balm, which thence did spring; Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread          Our eyes upon one double string; So to'intergraft our hands, as yet          Was all the means to make us one, And pictures in our eyes to get          Was all our propagation. As 'twixt two equal armies fate          Suspends uncertain victory, Our souls (which to advance their state          Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me. And whilst our souls negotiate there,          We like sepulchral statues lay; All day, the same our postures were,          And we said nothing, all the day. If any, so by love refin'd          That he soul's language understood, And by good love were grown all mind,          Within convenient distance stood, He (though he knew not which soul spake,          Because both meant, both spake the same) Might thence a new concoction take          And part far purer than he came. This ecstasy doth unperplex,          We said, and tell us what we love; We see by this it was not sex,          We see we saw not what did move; But as all several souls contain          Mixture of things, they know not what, Love these mix'd souls doth mix again          And makes both one, each this and that. A single violet transplant,          The strength, the colour, and the size, (All which before was poor and scant)          Redoubles still, and multiplies. When love with one another so          Interinanimates two souls, That abler soul, which thence doth flow,          Defects of loneliness controls. We then, who are this new soul, know          Of what we are compos'd and made, For th' atomies of which we grow          Are souls, whom no change can invade. But oh alas, so long, so far,          Our bodies why do we forbear? They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are          The intelligences, they the spheres. We owe them thanks, because they thus          Did us, to us, at first convey, Yielded their senses' force to us,          Nor are dross to us, but allay. On man heaven's influence works not so,          But that it first imprints the air; So soul into the soul may flow,             Though it to body first repair. As our blood labors to beget          Spirits, as like souls as it can, Because such fingers need to knit          That subtle knot which makes us man, So must pure lovers' souls descend          T' affections, and to faculties, Which sense may reach and apprehend,          Else a great prince in prison lies. To'our bodies turn we then, that so          Weak men on love reveal'd may look; Love's mysteries in souls do grow,          But yet the body is his book. And if some lover, such as we,          Have heard this dialogue of one, Let him still mark us, he shall see          Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.",John Donne,Fear
A Lecture upon the Shadow,"Stand still, and I will read to thee A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.          These three hours that we have spent,          Walking here, two shadows went Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd. But, now the sun is just above our head,          We do those shadows tread,          And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd. So whilst our infant loves did grow, Disguises did, and shadows, flow From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so. That love has not attain'd the high'st degree, Which is still diligent lest others see. Except our loves at this noon stay, We shall new shadows make the other way.          As the first were made to blind          Others, these which come behind Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes. If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,          To me thou, falsely, thine,          And I to thee mine actions shall disguise. The morning shadows wear away, But these grow longer all the day; But oh, love's day is short, if love decay. Love is a growing, or full constant light, And his first minute, after noon, is night.",John Donne,Joy

Edited by Helen Gardner and Timothy Healy, p. 155]         Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.

Satire III,"Kind pity chokes my spleen; brave scorn forbids Those tears to issue which swell my eyelids; I must not laugh, nor weep sins and be wise; Can railing, then, cure these worn maladies? Is not our mistress, fair Religion, As worthy of all our souls' devotion As virtue was in the first blinded age? Are not heaven's joys as valiant to assuage Lusts, as earth's honour was to them? Alas, As we do them in means, shall they surpass Us in the end? and shall thy father's spirit Meet blind philosophers in heaven, whose merit Of strict life may be imputed faith, and hear Thee, whom he taught so easy ways and near To follow, damn'd? Oh, if thou dar'st, fear this; This fear great courage and high valour is. Dar'st thou aid mutinous Dutch, and dar'st thou lay Thee in ships' wooden sepulchres, a prey To leaders' rage, to storms, to shot, to dearth? Dar'st thou dive seas, and dungeons of the earth? Hast thou courageous fire to thaw the ice Of frozen North discoveries? and thrice Colder than salamanders, like divine Children in th' oven, fires of Spain and the Line, Whose countries limbecs to our bodies be, Canst thou for gain bear? and must every he Which cries not, ""Goddess,"" to thy mistress, draw Or eat thy poisonous words? Courage of straw! O desperate coward, wilt thou seem bold, and To thy foes and his, who made thee to stand Sentinel in his world's garrison, thus yield, And for forbidden wars leave th' appointed field? Know thy foes: the foul devil, whom thou Strivest to please, for hate, not love, would allow Thee fain his whole realm to be quit; and as The world's all parts wither away and pass, So the world's self, thy other lov'd foe, is In her decrepit wane, and thou loving this, Dost love a wither'd and worn strumpet; last, Flesh (itself's death) and joys which flesh can taste, Thou lovest, and thy fair goodly soul, which doth Give this flesh power to taste joy, thou dost loathe. Seek true religion. O where? Mirreus, Thinking her unhous'd here, and fled from us, Seeks her at Rome; there, because he doth know That she was there a thousand years ago, He loves her rags so, as we here obey The statecloth where the prince sate yesterday. Crantz to such brave loves will not be enthrall'd, But loves her only, who at Geneva is call'd Religion, plain, simple, sullen, young, Contemptuous, yet unhandsome; as among Lecherous humours, there is one that judges No wenches wholesome, but coarse country drudges. Graius stays still at home here, and because Some preachers, vile ambitious bawds, and laws, Still new like fashions, bid him think that she Which dwells with us is only perfect, he Embraceth her whom his godfathers will Tender to him, being tender, as wards still Take such wives as their guardians offer, or Pay values. Careless Phrygius doth abhor All, because all cannot be good, as one Knowing some women whores, dares marry none. Graccus loves all as one, and thinks that so As women do in divers countries go In divers habits, yet are still one kind, So doth, so is Religion; and this blind- ness too much light breeds; but unmoved, thou Of force must one, and forc'd, but one allow, And the right; ask thy father which is she, Let him ask his; though truth and falsehood be Near twins, yet truth a little elder is; Be busy to seek her; believe me this, He's not of none, nor worst, that seeks the best. To adore, or scorn an image, or protest, May all be bad; doubt wisely; in strange way To stand inquiring right, is not to stray; To sleep, or run wrong, is. On a huge hill, Cragged and steep, Truth stands, and he that will Reach her, about must and about must go, And what the hill's suddenness resists, win so. Yet strive so that before age, death's twilight, Thy soul rest, for none can work in that night. To will implies delay, therefore now do; Hard deeds, the body's pains; hard knowledge too The mind's endeavours reach, and mysteries Are like the sun, dazzling, yet plain to all eyes. Keep the truth which thou hast found; men do not stand In so ill case, that God hath with his hand Sign'd kings' blank charters to kill whom they hate; Nor are they vicars, but hangmen to fate. Fool and wretch, wilt thou let thy soul be tied To man's laws, by which she shall not be tried At the last day? Oh, will it then boot thee To say a Philip, or a Gregory, A Harry, or a Martin, taught thee this? Is not this excuse for mere contraries Equally strong? Cannot both sides say so? That thou mayest rightly obey power, her bounds know; Those past, her nature and name is chang'd; to be Then humble to her is idolatry. As streams are, power is; those blest flowers that dwell At the rough stream's calm head, thrive and do well, But having left their roots, and themselves given To the stream's tyrannous rage, alas, are driven Through mills, and rocks, and woods, and at last, almost Consum'd in going, in the sea are lost. So perish souls, which more choose men's unjust Power from God claim'd, than God himself to trust.",John Donne,Joy
A Burnt Ship,"Out of a fired ship, which by no way But drowning could be rescued from the flame, Some men leap'd forth, and ever as they came Near the foes' ships, did by their shot decay; So all were lost, which in the ship were found,       They in the sea being burnt, they in the burnt ship drown'd.",John Donne,Anger

The Good-Morrow,"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then? But sucked on country pleasures, childishly? Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den? ’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be. If ever any beauty I did see, Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee. And now good-morrow to our waking souls, Which watch not one another out of fear; For love, all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room an everywhere. Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown, Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one. My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears, And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; Where can we find two better hemispheres, Without sharp north, without declining west? Whatever dies, was not mixed equally; If our two loves be one, or, thou and I Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.",John Donne,Joy
The Calm,"Our storm is past, and that storm's tyrannous rage, A stupid calm, but nothing it, doth 'suage. The fable is inverted, and far more A block afflicts, now, than a stork before. Storms chafe, and soon wear out themselves, or us; In calms, Heaven laughs to see us languish thus. As steady'as I can wish that my thoughts were, Smooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines there, The sea is now; and, as the isles which we Seek, when we can move, our ships rooted be. As water did in storms, now pitch runs out; As lead, when a fir'd church becomes one spout. And all our beauty, and our trim, decays, Like courts removing, or like ended plays. The fighting-place now seamen's rags supply; And all the tackling is a frippery. No use of lanthorns; and in one place lay Feathers and dust, to-day and yesterday. Earth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs are, Have no more wind than the upper vault of air. We can nor lost friends nor sought foes recover, But meteor-like, save that we move not, hover. Only the calenture together draws Dear friends, which meet dead in great fishes' jaws; And on the hatches, as on altars, lies Each one, his own priest, and own sacrifice. Who live, that miracle do multiply, Where walkers in hot ovens do not die. If in despite of these we swim, that hath No more refreshing than our brimstone bath; But from the sea into the ship we turn, Like parboil'd wretches, on the coals to burn. Like Bajazet encag'd, the shepherds' scoff, Or like slack-sinew'd Samson, his hair off, Languish our ships. Now as a myriad Of ants durst th' emperor's lov'd snake invade, The crawling gallies, sea-gaols, finny chips, Might brave our pinnaces, now bed-rid ships. Whether a rotten state, and hope of gain, Or to disuse me from the queasy pain Of being belov'd and loving, or the thirst Of honour, or fair death, out-push'd me first, I lose my end; for here, as well as I, A desperate may live, and a coward die. Stag, dog, and all which from or towards flies, Is paid with life or prey, or doing dies. Fate grudges us all, and doth subtly lay A scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to pray. He that at sea prays for more wind, as well Under the poles may beg cold, heat in hell. What are we then? How little more, alas, Is man now, than before he was? He was Nothing; for us, we are for nothing fit; Chance, or ourselves, still disproportion it. We have no power, no will, no sense; I lie, I should not then thus feel this misery.",John Donne,Joy
A Hymn to God the Father,"Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun,          Which was my sin, though it were done before?

When thou hast done, thou hast not done,                         For I have more. Wilt thou forgive that sin which I have won          Others to sin, and made my sin their door? Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun          A year or two, but wallow'd in, a score?                 When thou hast done, thou hast not done,                         For I have more. I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun          My last thread, I shall perish on the shore; But swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son          Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore;                 And, having done that, thou hast done;                         I fear no more.",John Donne,Anger
A Valediction of the Book,"I’ll tell thee now (dear Love) what thou shalt do     To anger destiny, as she doth us,     How I shall stay, though she esloygne me thus And how posterity shall know it too;          How thine may out-endure          Sybil’s glory, and obscure          Her who from Pindar could allure,     And her, through whose help Lucan is not lame, And her, whose book (they say) Homer did find, and name. Study our manuscripts, those myriads     Of letters, which have past twixt thee and me,     Thence write our annals, and in them will be   To all whom love’s subliming fire invades,          Rule and example found;          There, the faith of any ground          No schismatic will dare to wound,     That sees, how Love this grace to us affords, To make, to keep, to use, to be these his records. This book, as long-lived as the elements,     Or as the world’s form, this all-graved tome     In cipher writ, or new made idiom; We for love’s clergy only’are instruments,          When this book is made thus,          Should again the ravenous          Vandals and the Goths invade us,     Learning were safe; in this our universe Schools might learn sciences, spheres music, angels verse. Here Love’s divines (since all divinity     Is love or wonder) may find all they seek,     Whether abstract spiritual love they like, Their souls exhaled with what they do not see,          Or loth so to amuse          Faith’s infirmity, they choose          Something which they may see and use;     For, though mind be the heaven, where love doth sit, Beauty’a convenient type may be to figure it. Here more than in their books may lawyers find,     Both by what titles mistresses are ours,     And how prerogative these states devours, Transferred from Love himself, to womankind,          Who though from heart, and eyes,          They exact great subsidies,          Forsake him who on them relies     And for the cause, honor, or conscience give, Chimeras, vain as they, or their prerogative. Here statesmen (or of them, they which can read)     May of their occupation find the grounds,     Love and their art alike it deadly wounds, If to consider what’tis, one proceed,          In both they do excel          Who the present govern well,          Whose weakness none doth, or dares tell;     In this thy book, such will there nothing see, As in the Bible some can find out alchemy. Thus vent thy thoughts; abroad I’ll study thee,     As he removes far off, that great heights takes;     How great love is, presence best trial makes, But absence tries how long this love will be;          To take a latitude          Sun, or stars, are fitliest viewed          At their brightest, but to conclude,     Of longitudes, what other way have we, But to mark when, and where the dark eclipses be?",John Donne,Sadness
The Triple Fool,"I am two fools, I know,       For loving, and for saying so           In whining poetry; But where's that wiseman, that would not be I,           If she would not deny? Then as th' earth's inward narrow crooked lanes     Do purge sea water's fretful salt away, I thought, if I could draw my pains     Through rhyme's vexation, I should them allay. Grief brought to numbers cannot be so fierce, For he tames it, that fetters it in verse.       But when I have done so,       Some man, his art and voice to show,           Doth set and sing my pain; And, by delighting many, frees again           Grief, which verse did restrain. To love and grief tribute of verse belongs,     But not of such as pleases when 'tis read. Both are increased by such songs,     For both their triumphs so are published, And I, which was two fools, do so grow three; Who are a little wise, the best fools be.",John Donne,Anger
"Elegy VII: Nature’s lay idiot, I taught thee to love","Nature’s lay idiot, I taught thee to love, And in that sophistry, oh, thou dost prove Too subtle: Fool, thou didst not understand The mystic language of the eye nor hand: Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air Of sighs, and say, this lies, this sounds despair: Nor by the’eye’s water call a malady Desperately hot, or changing feverously. I had not taught thee then, the alphabet Of flowers, how they devicefully being set And bound up, might with speechless secrecy Deliver errands mutely, and mutually. Remember since all thy words used to be To every suitor, “I, ’if my friends agree”; Since, household charms, thy husband’s name to teach, Were all the love-tricks, that thy wit could reach; And since, an hour’s discourse could scarce have made One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed  In broken proverbs, and torn sentences. Thou art not by so many duties his, That from the’world’s common having severed thee, Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see, As mine: who have with amorous delicacies Refined thee’into a blissful paradise. Thy graces and good words my creatures be; I planted knowledge and life’s tree in thee, Which oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas  Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass?

Lovers' Infiniteness,"If yet I have not all thy love, Dear, I shall never have it all; I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move, Nor can intreat one other tear to fall; And all my treasure, which should purchase thee— Sighs, tears, and oaths, and letters—I have spent. Yet no more can be due to me, Than at the bargain made was meant; If then thy gift of love were partial, That some to me, some should to others fall,          Dear, I shall never have thee all. Or if then thou gavest me all, All was but all, which thou hadst then; But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall New love created be, by other men, Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears, In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me, This new love may beget new fears, For this love was not vow'd by thee. And yet it was, thy gift being general; The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall          Grow there, dear, I should have it all. Yet I would not have all yet, He that hath all can have no more; And since my love doth every day admit New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store; Thou canst not every day give me thy heart, If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it; Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart, It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it; But we will have a way more liberal, Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall          Be one, and one another's all.",John Donne,Sadness
The Relic,"When my grave is broke up again        Some second guest to entertain,        (For graves have learn'd that woman head,        To be to more than one a bed)                 And he that digs it, spies A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,                 Will he not let'us alone, And think that there a loving couple lies, Who thought that this device might be some way To make their souls, at the last busy day, Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?          If this fall in a time, or land,          Where mis-devotion doth command,          Then he, that digs us up, will bring          Us to the bishop, and the king,                 To make us relics; then Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I                 A something else thereby; All women shall adore us, and some men; And since at such time miracles are sought, I would have that age by this paper taught What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.          First, we lov'd well and faithfully,          Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;          Difference of sex no more we knew          Than our guardian angels do;                 Coming and going, we Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;                 Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free; These miracles we did, but now alas, All measure, and all language, I should pass, Should I tell what a miracle she was.",John Donne,Love
Phases,"I. There’s a little square in Paris, Waiting until we pass. They sit idly there, They sip the glass. There’s a cab-horse at the corner, There's rain. The season grieves. It was silver once, And green with leaves. There’s a parrot in a window, Will see us on parade, Hear the loud drums roll— And serenade.                            II. This was the salty taste of glory, That it was not Like Agamemnon’s story. Only, an eyeball in the mud, And Hopkins, Flat and pale and gory!                            III. But the bugles, in the night, Were wings that bore To where our comfort was; Arabesques of candle beams, Winding Through our heavy dreams; Winds that blew Where the bending iris grew; Birds of intermitted bliss, Singing in the night's abyss; Vines with yellow fruit, That fell Along the walls That bordered Hell.                            IV. Death's nobility again Beautified the simplest men. Fallen Winkle felt the pride Of Agamemnon When he died. What could London’s Work and waste Give him— To that salty, sacrificial taste? What could London’s Sorrow bring— To that short, triumphant sting?",Wallace Stevens,Joy
A Postcard from the Volcano,"Children picking up our bonesWill never know that these were once   As quick as foxes on the hill;And that in autumn, when the grapes   Made sharp air sharper by their smell   These had a being, breathing frost;And least will guess that with our bones   We left much more, left what still is   The look of things, left what we feltAt what we saw. The spring clouds blow   Above the shuttered mansion-house,   Beyond our gate and the windy skyCries out a literate despair.We knew for long the mansion's look   And what we said of it becameA part of what it is ... Children,   Still weaving budded aureoles,Will speak our speech and never know,Will say of the mansion that it seems   As if he that lived there left behind   A spirit storming in blank walls,A dirty house in a gutted world,A tatter of shadows peaked to white,   Smeared with the gold of the opulent sun.",Wallace Stevens,Joy
Peter Quince at the Clavier,"I Just as my fingers on these keys Make music, so the selfsame sounds On my spirit make a music, too. Music is feeling, then, not sound; And thus it is that what I feel, Here in this room, desiring you, Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk, Is music. It is like the strain Waked in the elders by Susanna: Of a green evening, clear and warm, She bathed in her still garden, while The red-eyed elders, watching, felt The basses of their beings throb In witching chords, and their thin blood Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.                                               II In the green water, clear and warm, Susanna lay. She searched The touch of springs, And found Concealed imaginings. She sighed, For so much melody. Upon the bank, she stood In the cool Of spent emotions. She felt, among the leaves, The dew Of old devotions. She walked upon the grass, Still quavering. The winds were like her maids, On timid feet, Fetching her woven scarves, Yet wavering. A breath upon her hand Muted the night. She turned— A cymbal crashed, And roaring horns.                                            III Soon, with a noise like tambourines, Came her attendant Byzantines. They wondered why Susanna cried Against the elders by her side; And as they whispered, the refrain Was like a willow swept by rain. Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame Revealed Susanna and her shame. And then, the simpering Byzantines Fled, with a noise like tambourines.                                              IV Beauty is momentary in the mind— The fitful tracing of a portal; But in the flesh it is immortal. The body dies; the body's beauty lives. So evenings die, in their green going, A wave, interminably flowing. So gardens die, their meek breath scenting The cowl of winter, done repenting. So maidens die, to the auroral Celebration of a maiden's choral. Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings Of those white elders; but, escaping, Left only Death's ironic scraping. Now, in its immortality, it plays On the clear viol of her memory, And makes a constant sacrament of praise.",Wallace Stevens,Joy
The Plain Sense of Things,"After the leaves have fallen, we returnTo a plain sense of things. It is as ifWe had come to an end of the imagination,Inanimate in an inert savoir.It is difficult even to choose the adjectiveFor this blank cold, this sadness without cause.The great structure has become a minor house.No turban walks across the lessened floors.The greenhouse never so badly needed paint.The chimney is fifty years old and slants to one side.A fantastic effort has failed, a repetitionIn a repetitiousness of men and flies.Yet the absence of the imagination hadItself to be imagined. The great pond,The plain sense of it, without reflections, leaves,Mud, water like dirty glass, expressing silenceOf a sort, silence of a rat come out to see,The great pond and its waste of the lilies, all thisHad to be imagined as an inevitable knowledge,Required, as a necessity requires.",Wallace Stevens,Surprise
Of Modern Poetry,"The poem of the mind in the act of finding   What will suffice. It has not always had   To find: the scene was set; it repeated what   Was in the script.                               Then the theatre was changed   To something else. Its past was a souvenir.It has to be living, to learn the speech of the place.   It has to face the men of the time and to meet   The women of the time. It has to think about war   And it has to find what will suffice. It has   To construct a new stage. It has to be on that stage   And, like an insatiable actor, slowly andWith meditation, speak words that in the ear,   In the delicatest ear of the mind, repeat,Exactly, that which it wants to hear, at the sound   Of which, an invisible audience listens,Not to the play, but to itself, expressedIn an emotion as of two people, as of two   Emotions becoming one. The actor isA metaphysician in the dark, twangingAn instrument, twanging a wiry string that gives   Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses, wholly   Containing the mind, below which it cannot descend,   Beyond which it has no will to rise.

There is no pith in musicExcept in something false. Bellissimo, pomposo,Sing a song of serpent-kin,Necks among the thousand leaves,Tongues around the fruit.Sing in clownish bootsStrapped and buckled bright. Wear the breeches of a mask,Coat half-flare and half galloon;Wear a helmet without reason,Tufted, tilted, twirled, and twisted.Start the singing in a voiceRougher than a grinding shale.

The Idea of Order at Key West,"She sang beyond the genius of the sea.   The water never formed to mind or voice,   Like a body wholly body, flutteringIts empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion   Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,   That was not ours although we understood,   Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.The sea was not a mask. No more was she.   The song and water were not medleyed sound   Even if what she sang was what she heard,   Since what she sang was uttered word by word.It may be that in all her phrases stirred   The grinding water and the gasping wind;   But it was she and not the sea we heard.For she was the maker of the song she sang.   The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured seaWas merely a place by which she walked to sing.   Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew   It was the spirit that we sought and knew   That we should ask this often as she sang.If it was only the dark voice of the sea   That rose, or even colored by many waves;   If it was only the outer voice of skyAnd cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,   However clear, it would have been deep air,   The heaving speech of air, a summer sound   Repeated in a summer without endAnd sound alone. But it was more than that,   More even than her voice, and ours, amongThe meaningless plungings of water and the wind,   Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped   On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres   Of sky and sea.                           It was her voice that made   The sky acutest at its vanishing.   She measured to the hour its solitude.   She was the single artificer of the worldIn which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,   Whatever self it had, became the selfThat was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,   As we beheld her striding there alone,Knew that there never was a world for her   Except the one she sang and, singing, made.Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,   Why, when the singing ended and we turned   Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,   The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,   As the night descended, tilting in the air,   Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,   Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,   Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,   The maker’s rage to order words of the sea,   Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,   And of ourselves and of our origins,In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.",Wallace Stevens,Fear

It comes of itself;And east rushes west and west rushes down,No matter. The grass is fullAnd full of yourself. The trees around are for you,   The whole of the wideness of night is for you,   A self that touches all edges,You become a self that fills the four corners of night.The red cat hides away in the fur-lightAnd there you are humped high, humped up,You are humped higher and higher, black as stone—You sit with your head like a carving in space   And the little green cat is a bug in the grass.",Wallace Stevens,Joy

The Man on the Dump,"Day creeps down. The moon is creeping up.The sun is a corbeil of flowers the moon Blanche   Places there, a bouquet. Ho-ho ... The dump is full   Of images. Days pass like papers from a press.   The bouquets come here in the papers. So the sun,   And so the moon, both come, and the janitor’s poems   Of every day, the wrapper on the can of pears,   The cat in the paper-bag, the corset, the boxFrom Esthonia: the tiger chest, for tea.The freshness of night has been fresh a long time.The freshness of morning, the blowing of day, one says   That it puffs as Cornelius Nepos reads, it puffs   More than, less than or it puffs like this or that.   The green smacks in the eye, the dew in the green   Smacks like fresh water in a can, like the seaOn a cocoanut—how many men have copied dew   For buttons, how many women have covered themselvesWith dew, dew dresses, stones and chains of dew, heads   Of the floweriest flowers dewed with the dewiest dew.   One grows to hate these things except on the dump.Now, in the time of spring (azaleas, trilliums,   Myrtle, viburnums, daffodils, blue phlox),   Between that disgust and this, between the things   That are on the dump (azaleas and so on)   And those that will be (azaleas and so on),   One feels the purifying change. One rejects   The trash.               That’s the moment when the moon creeps up   To the bubbling of bassoons. That’s the timeOne looks at the elephant-colorings of tires.   Everything is shed; and the moon comes up as the moon   (All its images are in the dump) and you seeAs a man (not like an image of a man),You see the moon rise in the empty sky.One sits and beats an old tin can, lard pail.One beats and beats for that which one believes.   That’s what one wants to get near. Could it after allBe merely oneself, as superior as the earTo a crow’s voice? Did the nightingale torture the ear,   Peck the heart and scratch the mind? And does the ear   Solace itself in peevish birds? Is it peace,Is it a philosopher’s honeymoon, one findsOn the dump?

VIIII know noble accents   And lucid, inescapable rhythms;   But I know, too,   That the blackbird is involved   In what I know.

"Easter, 1916","I have met them at close of day   Coming with vivid facesFrom counter or desk among grey   Eighteenth-century houses.I have passed with a nod of the head   Or polite meaningless words,   Or have lingered awhile and said   Polite meaningless words,And thought before I had done   Of a mocking tale or a gibe   To please a companionAround the fire at the club,   Being certain that they and I   But lived where motley is worn:   All changed, changed utterly:   A terrible beauty is born.That woman's days were spent   In ignorant good-will,Her nights in argumentUntil her voice grew shrill.What voice more sweet than hers   When, young and beautiful,   She rode to harriers?This man had kept a school   And rode our wingèd horse;   This other his helper and friend   Was coming into his force;He might have won fame in the end,   So sensitive his nature seemed,   So daring and sweet his thought.This other man I had dreamedA drunken, vainglorious lout.He had done most bitter wrongTo some who are near my heart,   Yet I number him in the song;He, too, has resigned his partIn the casual comedy;He, too, has been changed in his turn,   Transformed utterly:A terrible beauty is born.Hearts with one purpose alone   Through summer and winter seem   Enchanted to a stoneTo trouble the living stream.The horse that comes from the road,   The rider, the birds that range   From cloud to tumbling cloud,   Minute by minute they change;   A shadow of cloud on the stream   Changes minute by minute;   A horse-hoof slides on the brim,   And a horse plashes within it;   The long-legged moor-hens dive,   And hens to moor-cocks call;   Minute by minute they live:   The stone's in the midst of all.Too long a sacrificeCan make a stone of the heart.   O when may it suffice?That is Heaven's part, our part   To murmur name upon name,   As a mother names her child   When sleep at last has come   On limbs that had run wild.   What is it but nightfall?No, no, not night but death;   Was it needless death after all?For England may keep faith   For all that is done and said.

A Prayer for My Daughter,"Once more the storm is howling, and half hid   Under this cradle-hood and coverlid   My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle   But Gregory's Wood and one bare hill   Whereby the haystack and roof-levelling wind,   Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;   And for an hour I have walked and prayed   Because of the great gloom that is in my mind. I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour, And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower, And under the arches of the bridge, and scream In the elms above the flooded stream; Imagining in excited reverie That the future years had come   Dancing to a frenzied drum   Out of the murderous innocence of the sea. May she be granted beauty, and yet not   Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,   Or hers before a looking-glass; for such,   Being made beautiful overmuch,   Consider beauty a sufficient end,   Lose natural kindness, and maybe   The heart-revealing intimacy   That chooses right, and never find a friend. Helen, being chosen, found life flat and dull,   And later had much trouble from a fool;   While that great Queen that rose out of the spray,   Being fatherless, could have her way,   Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man.   It's certain that fine women eat   A crazy salad with their meat   Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone. In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;   Hearts are not had as a gift, but hearts are earned   By those that are not entirely beautiful.   Yet many, that have played the fool For beauty's very self, has charm made wise;   And many a poor man that has roved,   Loved and thought himself beloved,   From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes. May she become a flourishing hidden tree,   That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,   And have no business but dispensing round   Their magnanimities of sound;   Nor but in merriment begin a chase,   Nor but in merriment a quarrel.   Oh, may she live like some green laurel   Rooted in one dear perpetual place. My mind, because the minds that I have loved,   The sort of beauty that I have approved,   Prosper but little, has dried up of late,   Yet knows that to be choked with hate   May well be of all evil chances chief.   If there's no hatred in a mind   Assault and battery of the wind   Can never tear the linnet from the leaf. An intellectual hatred is the worst,   So let her think opinions are accursed.   Have I not seen the loveliest woman born Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,   Because of her opinionated mind   Barter that horn and every good   By quiet natures understood   For an old bellows full of angry wind? Considering that, all hatred driven hence,   The soul recovers radical innocence   And learns at last that it is self-delighting, Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,   And that its own sweet will is heaven's will,   She can, though every face should scowl   And every windy quarter howl   Or every bellows burst, be happy still. And may her bridegroom bring her to a house   Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;   For arrogance and hatred are the wares   Peddled in the thoroughfares.

Reconciliation,"Some may have blamed you that you took away The verses that could move them on the day When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind With lightning, you went from me, and I could find Nothing to make a song about but kings, Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things That were like memories of you—but now We'll out, for the world lives as long ago; And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit, Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.

The Sad Shepherd,"There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend, And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming, Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming And humming sands, where windy surges wend: And he called loudly to the stars to bend From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they Among themselves laugh on and sing alway: And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story! The sea swept on and cried her old cry still, Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill. He fled the persecution of her glory And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping, Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening. But naught they heard, for they are always listening, The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping. And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend Sought once again the shore, and found a shell, And thought, I will my heavy story tell Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart; And my own tale again for me shall sing, And my own whispering words be comforting, And lo! my ancient burden may depart. Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim; But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.",William Butler Yeats,Anger

Lapis Lazuli,"(for Harry Clifton)I have heard that hysterical women sayThey are sick of the palette and fiddle-bow,Of poets that are always gay,For everybody knows or else should knowThat if nothing drastic is doneAeroplane and Zeppelin will come out,Pitch like King Billy bomb-balls inUntil the town lie beaten flat.All perform their tragic play,There struts Hamlet, there is Lear,That's Ophelia, that Cordelia;Yet they, should the last scene be there,The great stage curtain about to drop,If worthy their prominent part in the play,Do not break up their lines to weep.They know that Hamlet and Lear are gay;Gaiety transfiguring all that dread.All men have aimed at, found and lost;Black out; Heaven blazing into the head:Tragedy wrought to its uttermost.Though Hamlet rambles and Lear rages,And all the drop scenes drop at onceUpon a hundred thousand stages,It cannot grow by an inch or an ounce.On their own feet they came, or on shipboard,Camel-back, horse-back, ass-back, mule-back,Old civilisations put to the sword.Then they and their wisdom went to rack:No handiwork of CallimachusWho handled marble as if it were bronze,Made draperies that seemed to riseWhen sea-wind swept the corner, stands;His long lamp chimney shaped like the stemOf a slender palm, stood but a day;All things fall and are built againAnd those that build them again are gay.Two Chinamen, behind them a third,Are carved in Lapis Lazuli,Over them flies a long-legged birdA symbol of longevity;The third, doubtless a serving-man,Carries a musical instrument.Every discolouration of the stone,Every accidental crack or dentSeems a water-course or an avalanche,Or lofty slope where it still snowsThough doubtless plum or cherry-branchSweetens the little half-way houseThose Chinamen climb towards, and IDelight to imagine them seated there;There, on the mountain and the sky,On all the tragic scene they stare.One asks for mournful melodies;Accomplished fingers begin to play.Their eyes mid many wrinkles, their eyes,Their ancient, glittering eyes, are gay.",William Butler Yeats,Sadness

What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves? Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime of his middle-age? Steady and long he struggles, He is baffled, bang’d, bruis’d, he holds out while his strength holds out, The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away, they roll him, swing him, turn him, His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruis’d on rocks, Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.",Walt Whitman,Surprise
I Saw in Louisiana A Live-Oak Growing,"I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing, All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches, Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green, And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself, But I wonder’d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for I knew I could not, And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little moss, And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room, It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends, (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,) Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love; For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide flat space, Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near, I know very well I could not.",Walt Whitman,Anger
A Noiseless Patient Spider,"A noiseless patient spider, I mark’d where on a little promontory it stood isolated, Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself, Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them. And you O my soul where you stand, Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space, Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them, Till the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold, Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.",Walt Whitman,Fear
Beat! Beat! Drums!,"Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!Through the windows—through doors—burst like a ruthless force,Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,Into the school where the scholar is studying,Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happiness must he have now with his bride,Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,So fierce you whirr and pound you drums—so shrill you bugles blow.Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!Over the traffic of cities—over the rumble of wheels in the streets;Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,No bargainers’ bargains by day—no brokers or speculators—would they continue?Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?Then rattle quicker, heavier drums—you bugles wilder blow.Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow!Make no parley—stop for no expostulation,Mind not the timid—mind not the weeper or prayer,Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,Let not the child’s voice be heard, nor the mother’s entreaties,Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses,So strong you thump O terrible drums—so loud you bugles blow.",Walt Whitman,Anger
"A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown","A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,Our army foil’d with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,’Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospitalEntering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made,Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke,By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down,At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster’s face is white as a lily,)Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o’er the scene fain to absorb it all,Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, some of them dead,Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the odor of blood,The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill’d,Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death-spasm sweating,An occasional scream or cry, the doctor’s shouted orders or calls,The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches,These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,The unknown road still marching.",Walt Whitman,Fear

The World Below the Brine,"The world below the brine, Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves, Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick tangle, openings, and pink turf, Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold, the play of light through the water, Dumb swimmers there among the rocks, coral, gluten, grass, rushes, and the aliment of the swimmers, Sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling close to the bottom, The sperm-whale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting with his flukes, The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea-leopard, and the sting-ray, Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those ocean-depths, breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do, The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere, The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres.",Walt Whitman,Fear
Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field one Night,"Vigil strange I kept on the field one night; When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day, One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall never forget, One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground, Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle, Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way, Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind, Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battle-field spreading, Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night, But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed, Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands, Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade—not a tear, not a word, Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier, As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole, Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death, I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,) Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d, My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form, Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet, And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited, Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim, Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,) Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten’d, I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket, And buried him where he fell.",Walt Whitman,Anger

As I Ebb’d with the Ocean of Life,"1 As I ebb’d with the ocean of life, As I wended the shores I know, As I walk’d where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok, Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant, Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways, I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward, Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems, Was seiz’d by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot, The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land of the globe. Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those slender windrows, Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,   Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide, Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me, Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses, These you presented to me you fish-shaped island, As I wended the shores I know, As I walk’d with that electric self seeking types.                                              2 As I wend to the shores I know not, As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck’d, As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me, As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer, I too but signify at the utmost a little wash’d-up drift, A few sands and dead leaves to gather, Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift. O baffled, balk’d, bent to the very earth, Oppress’d with myself that I have dared to open my mouth, Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have not once had the least idea who or what I am, But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet untouch’d, untold, altogether unreach’d, Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows, With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written, Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath. I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single object, and that no man ever can, Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me, Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.                                              3 You oceans both, I close with you, We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing not why, These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all. You friable shore with trails of debris, You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot, What is yours is mine my father. I too Paumanok, I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been wash’d on your shores, I too am but a trail of drift and debris, I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island. I throw myself upon your breast my father, I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me, I hold you so firm till you answer me something. Kiss me my father, Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love, Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy.                                              4 Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,) Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother, Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me, Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or gather from you. I mean tenderly by you and all, I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead, and following me and mine. Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses, Froth, snowy white, and bubbles, (See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last, See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,) Tufts of straw, sands, fragments, Buoy’d hither from many moods, one contradicting another, From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell, Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil, Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown, A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at random, Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature, Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets, We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you, You up there walking or sitting, Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.",Walt Whitman,Anger
A Glimpse,"A glimpse through an interstice caught,Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night, and I unremark’d seated in a corner,Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and oath and smutty jest,There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word.",Walt Whitman,Joy
"""Out of the rolling ocean the crowd""","Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me,Whispering, I love you, before long I die,I have travell’d a long way merely to look on you to touch you,For I could not die till I once look’d on you,For I fear’d I might afterward lose you.",Walt Whitman,Fear
When I Heard at the Close of the Day,"When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv’d with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that follow’d,And else when I carous’d, or when my plans were accomplish’d, still I was not happy,But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh’d, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light,When I wander’d alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O then I was happy,O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food nourish’d me more, and the beautiful day pass’d well,And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came my friend,And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores,I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me, For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night,In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,And his arm lay lightly around my breast – and that night I was happy.",Walt Whitman,Joy

On the Beach at Night,"On the beach at night, Stands a child with her father, Watching the east, the autumn sky. Up through the darkness, While ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading, Lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky, Amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east, Ascends large and calm the lord-star Jupiter, And nigh at hand, only a very little above, Swim the delicate sisters the Pleiades. From the beach the child holding the hand of her father, Those burial-clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all, Watching, silently weeps. Weep not, child, Weep not, my darling, With these kisses let me remove your tears, The ravening clouds shall not long be victorious, They shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only in apparition, Jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the Pleiades shall emerge, They are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall shine out again, The great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they endure, The vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive moons shall again shine. Then dearest child mournest thou only for Jupiter? Considerest thou alone the burial of the stars? Something there is, (With my lips soothing thee, adding I whisper, I give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,) Something there is more immortal even than the stars, (Many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,) Something that shall endure longer even than lustrous Jupiter Longer than sun or any revolving satellite, Or the radiant sisters the Pleiades.",Walt Whitman,Love

Trail of Tears: Our Removal,"With lines unseen the land was broken.When surveyors came, we knewwhat the prophet had said was true,this land with unseen lines would be taken.So, you who live there now,don't forget to love it, thank itthe place that was once our forest,our ponds, our mosses,the swamplands with birds and more lowly creatures.As for us, we walked into the military strength of hungerand war for that land we still dream.As the ferry crossed the distance,or as the walkers left behind their loved ones,think how we took with us our cats and kittens,the puppies we loved. We were innocent of what we faced,along the trail. We took clothing, dishes,thinking there would be something to start a new life,believing justice lived in the world,and the horses, so many,one by one stolen, taken by the many thievesSo have compassion for that land at least.Every step we took was one away from the songs,old dances, memories, some of us dark and not speaking English,some of us white, or married to the dark, or children of translatorsthe half-white, all of us watched by America, all of uslonging for trees for shade, homing, rooting,even more for food along the hunger way.You would think those of us born laterwould fight for justice, for peace,for the new land, its trees being taken.You would thinkthe struggle would be overbetween the two worlds in this placethat is now our knowledge,our new belonging, our being,and we'd never again care for the notion of mapsor American wars, or the god of their sky,thinking of those things we were forced to leave behind,living country, stolen home,the world measured inch by inch, mile by mile,hectares, all measurements, even the trail of our tears.With all the new fierce light, heat, droughtthe missing water, you'd thinkin another red century, the old wisdommight exist if we considered enoughthat even before the new beliefswe were once whole,but now our bodies and minds remainthe measured geography.",Linda Hogan,Love

Oxtail Stew,"At five o’clock in the morning,I walked to work and passed the green pondsof Horizon Park where the last bluegill,caught on the low, slight bank,panted hard in the dark mud, crushed glass,sour bottle caps, whiskey,and the iron weight of heat and smog.This haze stared through eyesgray as the broken window paneson the cheap side of town,and when this haze held youand whispered in your ears its quiet tragedies,it stole your breath quick as time.This is where men gathered to sell peanuts,buckets of oranges, and roses,and they sat on the benches and watchedthe trucks drive by and disappear.What I want to say is simple:a man must do more than sell roseswhere the bums go and beg—he must keep something holy.He must breath the windsthat rustle the orchards of the valleywhere the white almond bloomsreplenish with their soft scent.He must learn from the Appaloosawhen she walks in from the fieldsand bows her head to a trough of waterthat reflects nothing but her eyes and the stars.Shoulder, fat, bone, and loose sheet metalbanged out a day-long cacophony.Twenty-eight pounds of spicehad to be mixed before the grinder was done.Mustard powder, paprika, salt,and chili powder boiled in my nose,in my eyes, and in the red throbof my hard nicked-up knuckles.By late morning the meat defrosted,and the boxes began their ooze.Pig parts became easy to recognize.Eighty pounds of guts, kidneys,and stomach fell across my chesteach time a box ripped apart.We dared not stop the music of our work:the clack of a clean pine pallet,pink meat and white fat ground to a pulp,sweetened, stuffed, and crimped,the chorizo boxed, the boxes labeled,stacked, and wrapped.At lunch, I watched Guillermo hunker over the tableand dig into his stew—carrots, potatoes,celery, oxtail, and gravy, made fromchili peppers and fat, smoldering in a ceramic bowl.Guillermo took out a white cotton napkinand spread it evenly across his lap,picked up a piece of sourdough rippedfrom a loaf and soaked the bread in the stewfor a long time . . . his own tired bodytaking back what the work took, and he ate.He sucked on chili peppers the color of bloodand took another bite of the bread.He sucked out the beef from the eyes of the bonesand gnawed on the soft marrow,and he drank hot coffee sweetened con canela.“Eloisa,” he said, “can cook,” and he touchedthe brown lace crocheted into the edgeof his cotton napkin, rubbed his gut, wiped the table,and walked out to complete his work.",David Dominguez,Fear

No one got hurt. The vehiclessped over its branches. The dust blewinto the windshields ... / The cypress broke, butthe pigeon in a neighboring house didn’t changeits public nest. And two migrant birds hovered abovethe hem of the place, and exchanged some symbols.And a woman said to her neighbor: Say, did you see a storm?She said: No, and no bulldozer either ... / And the cypressbroke. And those passing by the wreckage said:Maybe it got bored with being neglected, or it grew oldwith the days, it is long like a giraffe, and littlein meaning like a dust broom, and couldn’t shade two lovers.And a boy said: I used to draw it perfectly,its figure was easy to draw.

Work Shy,"To be poor and raise skinny children. To own nothing but skinny clothing. Skinny food falls in between cracks. Friends cannot visit your skinny home. They cannot fit through the door. Your skinny thoughts evaporate into the day or the night that you cannot see with your tiny eyes. God sticks you with the smallest pins and your blood, the red is diluted. Imagine a tiny hole, the other side of which is a fat world and how lost you would feel. Of course, I’m speaking to myself. How lost I would feel, and how dangerous.",Alex Phillips,Anger
The Destruction of Sennacherib,"The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.   Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,That host with their banners at sunset were seen:Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.   For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!   And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.   And there lay the rider distorted and pale,With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.   And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!",Lord Byron (George Gordon),Anger
The Mother’s Charge,"She raised her head. With hot and glittering eye, ‘I know,’ she said, ‘that I am going to die. Come here, my daughter, while my mind is clear. Let me make plain to you your duty here; My duty once — I never failed to try—   But for some reason I am going to die.’ She raised her head, and, while her eyes rolled wild, Poured these instructions on the gasping child: ‘Begin at once — don’t iron sitting down—   Wash your potatoes when the fat is brown—   Monday, unless it rains — it always pays To get fall sewing done on the right days—   A carpet-sweeper and a little broom—   Save dishes — wash the summer dining-room With soda — keep the children out of doors—   The starch is out — beeswax on all the floors—   If girls are treated like your friends they stay—   They stay, and treat you like their friends — the way To make home happy is to keep a jar —   And save the prettiest pieces for the star In the middle — blue’s too dark — all silk is best—   And don’t forget the corners — when they’re dressed Put them on ice — and always wash the chest Three times a day, the windows every week—   We need more flour — the bedroom ceilings leak—   It’s better than onion — keep the boys at home—   Gardening is good — a load, three loads of loam—   They bloom in spring — and smile, smile always, dear—   Be brave, keep on — I hope I’ve made it clear.’ She died, as all her mothers died before.

Swapping Minds,"(for Vanessa)Melissa and I were sitting   by the little lake in Green   Park in London playing   “swapping minds.” It’s anold game that came down from   the Lowlands.

And we had   a half bottle of Chardonnay   between us.Here is how the game of   “swapping minds” goes. It’s   not a child’s game, it’s   very intellectual, or should   I say psychological. Just   imagine Melissa and I are   talking. She says something   to me, “James why are you   always so arrogant?” But,   obviously that’s not what   she is thinking. To answer   her I must try to imagine   what she was thinking when   she asked that. I must swap   minds with her.I ventured the following:   “Melissa, you have the mostlovely white skin in England,   you must be careful   not to get sunburned.Melissa: “James, why do you   pretend you are Scots when   you’re really of Irish descent?”James: “Melissa, are you   remembering the handsome   Russian boy you met in the   Hermitage on your trip to   Russia and he took you to have   an ice cream with him?”Melissa: “James, did theother boys in school tease   you because you were so bad   at games?”James: “Do you really love   me or are you just flirting?”Melissa: “I’m sorry, James,   but the response is in your   mind, not in mine.”That was the end of the   “swapping game” for that   day, and such a happy day   it was, there in Green Park,   watching the ducks on the   pond.",James Laughlin,Joy

They bring me on one of thosedaytime talk shows, and before being reunited, we are kept in separate rooms, thetelevision split screen, green-towel man in the audience. I'm still white, so are you,both of us middle-aged with freckles and strawberry-blonde hair. Later I'm theviewer at home thinking, Like hell they'll fall for each other.",Esther Lee,Anger
Harvest of Death,"(Civil War Photography by T. O’Sullivan, 1866)Raisin-black blood dries on their faces.Thick wool clothes.Lumps of bloated bodieslying on their backs. Mouths open. Chinspointing to the sky.As though blown over backward.Or turned. Fingers swollen.Boots and rifles missing.Coats and jackets pulled upexposing gray shirts, bloody underwear. The sky drifts toward sap green.No fences. No stone walls.",John Spaulding,Sadness

Winter,"Behold the gloomy tyrant’s awful formBinding the captive earth in icy chains;His chilling breath sweeps o’er the watery plains,Howls in the blast, and swells the rising storm.See from its centre bends the rifted tower,Threat’ning the lowly vale with frowning pride,O’er the scared flocks that seek its sheltering side,A fearful ruin o’er their heads to pour.While to the cheerful hearth and social boardContent and ease repair, the sons of wantReceive from niggard fate their pittance scant;And where some shed bleak covert may afford,Wan poverty, amidst her meagre hostCasts round her haggard eyes, and shivers at the frost.",Anne Hunter,Joy

A Walk in the River,"A few companions had been doing too much talking beside the purple water. The troupe, panic-stricken, ran away, and I found I was incapable of following them. I stepped into the water and the depths turned luminous; faraway ferns could just be seen. The reflections of other dark plants stopped them rising to the surface. Red threads took on all sorts of shapes, caught in the invisible and doubtless powerful currents. A plaster-cast woman advancing caused me to make a gesture which was to take me far.

How We Made a New Art on Old Ground,"A famous battle happened in this valley.                        You never understood the nature poem.   Till now. Till this moment—if these statements                        seem separate, unrelated, follow this   silence to its edge and you will hear                        the history of air: the crispness of a fern   or the upward cut and turn around of                        a fieldfare or thrush written on it.   The other history is silent: The estuary                        is over there. The issue was decided here:   Two kings prepared to give no quarter.                        Then one king and one dead tradition.   Now the humid dusk, the old wounds                        wait for language, for a different truth:   When you see the silk of the willow                        and the wider edge of the river turn   and grow dark and then darker, then                        you will know that the nature poem   is not the action nor its end: it is                        this rust on the gate beside the trees, onthe cattle grid underneath our feet,                        on the steering wheel shaft: it is   an aftermath, an overlay and even in                        its own modest way, an art of peace:I try the word distance and it fills with                        sycamores, a summer's worth of pollen   And as I write valley straw, metal                        blood, oaths, armour are unwritten.   Silence spreads slowly from these words                        to those ilex trees half in, half out   of shadows falling on the shallow ford                        of the south bank beside Yellow Island   as twilight shows how this sweet corrosion                        begins to be complete: what we see   is what the poem says:                        evening coming—cattle, cattle-shadows—and whin bushes and a change of weather                        about to change them all: what we see is howthe place and the torment of the place are                        for this moment free of one another.",Eavan Boland,Anger
The Man Who Gave Birth to a Panda,"He had to have it, his mother told him. How could he not, with so few left in the world? He felt heaviest at night with the miracle of it. He was a vessel now. A receptacle for a threatened being. What if he rose too fast and killed it? Or maybe his stillness would do it, too much sitting around, stunned and hungry. And what if the bear emerged alive and another formed in its place, would he have to have that one, too, and another one after that?  He dreamed of the panda’s tiny eyes opening inside him, the doctor’s wide incision, a whirring pain, and then the furry thing emerging, the bear turning to him as to a stranger and whether that would be it—his bit part in the history of the future.",Idra Novey,Surprise

Ah kingly kiss—no more regret   nor old deep memories   to mar the bliss;   where the low sedge is thick,   the gold day-lily   outspreads and rests   beneath soft fluttering   of red swan wingsand the warm quiveringof the red swan's breast.",H.

Aubade with Bread for the Sparrows,"The snow voids the distance of the roadand the first breath comes from the early morningghosts. The sparrows with their hard eyesglisten in the difficult light.

What’s leftbut to watch the daylight halved by the glistening ground?What’s left but an empty bag and the dust of breadravaged by songsters?

The Redeemer,"Darkness: the rain sluiced down; the mire was deep;   It was past twelve on a mid-winter night,When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep;   There, with much work to do before the light,   We lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we might   Along the trench; sometimes a bullet sang,   And droning shells burst with a hollow bang;   We were soaked, chilled and wretched, every one;   Darkness; the distant wink of a huge gun.I turned in the black ditch, loathing the storm;   A rocket fizzed and burned with blanching flare,   And lit the face of what had been a form   Floundering in mirk. He stood before me there;   I say that He was Christ; stiff in the glare,   And leaning forward from His burdening task,   Both arms supporting it; His eyes on mine   Stared from the woeful head that seemed a mask   Of mortal pain in Hell’s unholy shine.No thorny crown, only a woollen capHe wore—an English soldier, white and strong,   Who loved his time like any simple chap,   Good days of work and sport and homely song;   Now he has learned that nights are very long,   And dawn a watching of the windowed sky.   But to the end, unjudging, he’ll endure   Horror and pain, not uncontent to die   That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure.He faced me, reeling in his weariness,Shouldering his load of planks, so hard to bear.   I say that He was Christ, who wrought to bless   All groping things with freedom bright as air,   And with His mercy washed and made them fair.   Then the flame sank, and all grew black as pitch,   While we began to struggle along the ditch;   And someone flung his burden in the muck,   Mumbling: ‘O Christ Almighty, now I’m stuck!’",Siegfried Sassoon,Fear

Infidelity,"You have not conquered me—it is the surgeOf love itself that beats against my will;It is the sting of conflict, the old urgeThat calls me still.It is not you I love—it is the formAnd shadow of all lovers who have diedThat gives you all the freshness of a warmAnd unfamiliar bride.It is your name I breathe, your hands I seek;It will be you when you are gone.And yet the dream, the name I never speak,Is that that lures me on.It is the golden summons, the bright waveOf banners calling me anew;It is all beauty, perilous and grave—It is not you.",Louis Untermeyer,Surprise
The Delta Parade,"Everything stops.A fat man on his way to Baltimore   smokes for three hours in the club car.The porter slips out and calls his wife,he has one dime left and he’s almost   yelling. Somewhere south of York,   she thinks he said. The funeral   procession leaves its lights on   and out of this pure stubbornness   its batteries go dead.The bank robber leans on his horn   in desperation while his partner   snaps the rubber bands around   the money. A band,you can hear it up the river,first like the new heart of the child onyour lap, then like an old moon   pulsing below your nails, or somethingsoftly moving through your arms and   throat. Here,press here, not just drums.A clown is throwing caramels   at the porch rails, balloonsare exploding or sailing up the river.   The lucky trees, to be able   to stand that close. If we talk   too much, we’ll surely miss it.And at the still centerof summer it starts; cowboys ride out outof another life, old cars get upfrom the dead and dancelike cripples hired out for a tent meeting.   Up and down the sidewalk, the town   sucks in its breath like a girltaking short gasps just above her trumpet,   or a fire engine’s horn, heavinglike a drowned man or a heat wave slapping   against the water tower, this afternoon   just like a parade. The sore-footed   ponies are loaded down with flags   and the library float says“Immortal Shakespeare,” says itwith carnations and the hides of roses,   says it with a jester and a princess   wearing wings.And she stutters, but no one cares   or can hear her. Except for the man   on the unicycle who tips his top hat   to the crowd, who swears he will   follow her anywhere, who follows   the mayor and the city council, who   follows the tap dancing class and the Future   Farmers, the Lions Club and the Veterans   of Foreign Wars; who clasps a carnation   between his teeth and sways   back and forth likea broken clock.And then things begin again,a car follows the man on the unicycle   and suddenly it’s just another car,   a pair of dice danglingfrom the rearview mirror, a woman   giving her breast to a child and another   child carefully peeling a crayon, then   slowly giving the peels to hisgrandmother, who opens the big brass   clasps of her pocketbook and lets   the bright curls drop slowlyto the bottomlike confetti or a boy’s firsthaircut. Like a first yellow leafthat fell when we weren’t looking.Because it’s summer. Like a smooth   yellow pebble that is rubbing and rubbing   in the new left boot of the drummer,   that someone skimmed on the river   exactly at three o’clock.Not out of anger or of boredomthis time, but as if it could almost   wear wings.",Susan Stewart,Fear
Money,"Women want to save you or want you to savage them.Men want to see what is under your towel.The dollar bills they throw into your cageare all you need to care about becauseyou aren’t dancing in a cage to entertain them. You dance in a cage to make money. I openmy towel to the right then whip it back toward midlinejust as I open to the left: I show them nothing.But I have them convinced I will show them something.There is a difference between men and women— you must look women in the eyes and, if possible,look hurt; with men, you must avoid lookingat them altogether, you must focus on moving your hips,which is close to what they are actually watching.Suspended in a cage above the far end of the dance floor, I was not attainable; Imade myself seem attainable. These are just the basics.Wearing nothing but a towel, my greyish wingsextended to full wingspan, my chest shaved—the clubbers believe I am wearing a costume. It is amazing what people believe. The musicis cheaper than a Budweiser. The air is smoke andthe smell of smoke mixed with sweat, and your jobis to convince each of them you are dancing for no one else.When my shift is over and I pull on some jeans, tuck my wings and bandage them down, pull on two shirts,I can almost pretend I never entered that cage in the first place.Outside on Lansdowne Street, there are people standingin one line or another waiting to get in to clubs.Night after night, the same thing: the waiting never ends.",C.

The Silence,"She took the spareribs out of the ovenand set them steaming on a platebefore leaving her apartment.I didn't know how long to wait,tore into cold meat when I decided  my mother wasn't coming back.   *   No one knew about the gun she kept in her purse until the authoritiescalled—a .38 caliber pistolwith a pearl handle and a triggereven she could easily pull—her car still waiting to be towed from a roadside ditch   when they arrived on the scene.   *   Yesterday morning, I was leaning over a kitchen sink, my husband upstairs sleeping. Between his snores muffled under a down comforter and a portable electric heater that kept our bedroom warm, I knew I could sob as loud as I wanted   without disturbing his dreams.   *   At the sports arena between musical acts and clouds of dope, I texted my lover a wide-angle shot of the stage—the reception bars on my phone bouncing back and forth between high and low—a text I had to send several times before it went through even though there was a chance his phone would be off or the text get lost for hours in the ether, even days.   The silence is the agony.   *   My therapist says: It's not your fault. No way for you to have known exactly where your mother was headed.   Then why am I left weepingin my kitchen decades after the fact?   When I went upstairs and sat beside my husband, he could feel the mattress shift beneath our weight even though I felt much lighter after watching translucent ropes of snot lowering down into the sink, arms around me when I asked if he   was awake, knowing that he wasn't.   *   How many romances get derailed when a text that has been sent fails to go through?

Insect Life of Florida,"In those days I thought their endless thrum   was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights.      In the throats of hibiscus and oleanderI’d see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells   enameled hard as the sky before the rain.      All that summer, my second, from cityto city my young father drove the black coupe   through humid mornings I’d wake to like fever      parceled between luggage and sample goods.Afternoons, showers drummed the roof,   my parents silent for hours. Even then I knew      something of love was cruel, was distant.Mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid   Father’d pinned in her hair shriveled      to a purple fist. A necklace of shellscoiled her throat, moving a little as she   murmured of alligators that float the rivers      able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoeswhose bite would make you sleep a thousand years.   And always the trance of blacktop shimmering      through swamps with names like incantations—Okeefenokee, where Father held my hand   and pointed to an egret’s flight unfolding      white above swamp reeds that sang with insectsuntil I was lost, until I was part   of the singing, their thousand wings gauze      on my body, tattooing my skin.Father rocked me later by the water,   the motel balcony, singing calypso      with the Jamaican radio. The lyricsa net over the sea, its lesson   of desire and repetition. Lizards flashed      over his shoes, over the railwhere the citronella burned merging our   shadows—Father’s face floating over mine      in the black changing soundof night, the enormous Florida night,   metallic with cicadas, musical      and dangerous as the human heart.",Lynda Hull,Anger

He pointed out which treeswere sweetest, which ones bore double seeds—puffing outthe flesh and oh the surprise on your tongue with two tiny stones(a twin spit), making a small gun of your mouth. Did I mentionmy favorite color is red? His jeans were worn and twistyaround the tops of his boot; his hands thick but careful, nimble enough to pull fruit from his trees without tearingthe thin skin; the cherry dust and fingerprints on his eyeglasses. I just know when he stuffed his hands in his pockets, saidOkay. Couldn't hurt to try? and shuffled back to his roadside standto arrange his jelly jars and stacks of buckets, I had madea terrible mistake.

Messenger,"for John GardnerIt was not kindness, but I was only buckle-high in the door.I let him in because the knock had come, the rainclawed each window and wall. I was afraid.Climbing down the stairs I did not knowhow my country, cunningly, had rotted,but hear, now, my steps creak in memoryand the rocks let go in the blind nightglasswhere you get up, frightened, to reenactthe irrational logic of flesh.Even now I can’t see why it happens, the moment of change,but must try to witness each particular indexof landscape and irony of promise. I knowI was a child when the banging began, sleeplesswith every light in the house blazing. Thenthe man whose speech entangled me came infrom the mud-world. He could notput together the clear words of hopewe dream, only the surge of a river.He, who said it wasn’t a fit thingfor anyone, half-grown, to have to imagine in this godforsakenlife, said there was a message, the river high,no chance. I remember the wind at that doorbreaking like a father’s hand on my face.Such hurting does not cease and maybethat is why the man went on fumblingfor love, for the loving wordsthat might be knowledge. He gave methis message. I took it, and took, without warning, grief’slanguage that piece by piece has shown me howto connect dreamed moments skidding like rocksin the silence of a Wyoming midnight.Each of his rainy words, fragmentsof the old sickness, passed into me,then he was gone, miserable and emptied,and I had no home but the heart’s hut,the blistering walls of loneliness,the world’s blue skymiles of longing.Common with drowned fir and uncoiling crocus, then, Iwalked in ignorance and entered this terrible lifethat was always a dream of the futurein the relentless unsleep of thosewho cannot remember the last thing they wantedto say: that love exists. And in darknessyou have dreamed me into your worldwith their message, their wordswhispering an hour before black, sudden knockingthat, even as I recall it, begins in your heart’s meatto reverberate, oh, its noise is goingto wake you like a dove’s desire.This is the dream of the soft bucklingof flesh, the beautiful last erosions,and I swear I would give up these wordsif I could, I would stop the codeof that streetlight just beyond your bed—but it is too late, for the secret of hope swells in youand who can stop the news that already screamslike the roof’s edge leaving its nailsover your child’s bed that is, now,splintered and empty as every momentskidding at the back of your neck? Leavesnot a month old hurl out of the stormand steady splatter of time, and tomorrowwill lie still ripening, but only long enoughfor you to catalog, in dream, what was possiblebefore the rake must drag its scritch-scratch over ground.All I ask is that you turn to the childinside, those words dreaming and changelessas love’s last chance—let them be saidagainst whatever, crying in the night,we still think may be stopped, the blackhistorical fact of life’s eventcrashing, like a wall of water,over the actuary’s lawn and yours.You have seen me before and would not hear, stung by yourwife’s fierce beauty, when I called your name,and the day your mother died I beggedyour attention and got your dollar.I followed you once, in New York, like truth,always to give you the message, and nowon your porch, mud-spattered, I amknocking to make you see what love is.Call your wife, the police, anyone you like,for everyone is waiting. We don’t mean to be unkind but arecompelled to deliver, faithfully, the wordsthat have been fluttering in your earlike a scream.

Even the ceramic collie on the windowsill Cocks an ear as the tune lifts and the taut sail Of the Galway hooker trills wildly in its frame on the wall, Rippling to the salt pulse and seabreeze of a West Clare reel. Many a night, two octaves of one tune, We sat here side by side, your body awake To a jig or slide, me mending the drift of a line As the music found a path to my notebook. Lost in its lilt and plunge I would disappear Into the heathery freedom of a slow air Or walk out under the powerful stars to clear My head of thought and breathe their cooled-down fire. When my own session ends, let me leave like that, Porous to the wind that blows off the ocean. Goodbye to the company and step into the night Completed and one-off, like a well-played tune— Beyond the purified essence of hearth fires Rising from the life of the parish, past smoke and stars, Released from everything I've done and known. I won't go willingly, it's true, but I'll be gone.",Richard Tillinghast,Joy
A Book on a Shelf,"A history of some sort, one that made us, a war and what the war had meant, or since meaning eludes war, what it did to the look of the trees and the sides of the buildings, most of which survived, only to be torn down later to widen the street or put up a new office complex. There it was on the shelf. I was there only a moment, but still, I wanted to know what happened to the man in the photograph wearing a flat cap standing outside the important building cheering. He was there. He was part of that moment, one of the first into the streets when the turn of events came, the declaration or pronouncement, words that would change the look of everything he smiled on, words that may have cost him his life. Here it is in a book I found on a shelf. The person who lives here bought it at a library stock reduction sale. No one had read it. It looked interesting thirty years ago. It was practically new, the back uncracked. But the person did what those before her had, put it up on a shelf and never found a way back to it. The history sits there, unread, unbelievable, somebody else's. Even I have only looked at the pictures, at the man smiling between the cold pages. Maybe ending the world as he knew it was ok. Maybe it was the only way. Maybe the world has to come to an end in the first place to be the world. And the man? He has to smile, though he knows so little of what's coming, even looking right at it. As we do, who still haven't read the book.",Roger Mitchell,Fear

Apology for Apostasy?,"Soft songs, like birds, die in poison airSo my song cannot now be candy.Anger rots the oak and elm; roses are rare,Seldom seen through blind despair.And my murmur cannot be heardAbove the din and damn.

Cossacks and Bandits,"I grew up in a village built on coal and labor.An outhouse on a dirt road by a water pumpglared at the whitewashed fences of uniformed yardsthat gaped like broken teeth in the mouths of miners.All summer we played Cossacks and Bandits,shot our symbolic rifles and revolversand when killed would crush a wild cherryin the breast pocket, the spot where the heart stopped.Who started it?

A Knot of Worms,"As day began to break, we passedthe “honk for worms” sign,passed it honking againand again, to wake up the wormsmy dad said.

The Sun,"There is one mind in all of us, one soul,   who parches the soil in some nations but in others hides perpetually behind a veil;   he spills light everywhere, here he spilled some on my tie, but it dried before dinner ended.   He is in charge of darkness also, also in charge of crime, in charge of the imagination.   People fucking do so by flicking him off and on, off and on, with their eyelids   as they ascertain their love's sincerity. He makes the stars disappear, but he makes   small stars everywhere, on the hoods of cars, in the ommatea of skyscrapers or in the eyes   of sighing lovers bored with one another. Onto the surface of the world he stamps   all plants and animals. They are not gods but it is he who made us worshippers of every    bramble toad, black chive we find. In Idaho there is a desert cricket that makes   a clock-like tick-tick when he flies, but he is not a god. The only god is the sun,   our mind, master of all crickets and clocks.",Dan Chiasson,Joy

A Hot Time in a Small Town,"In this restaurant a plate of bluefish pâtéand matzos begin memorable meals. The cracker is ridged, seems planked, an old wallstreaked sepia, very nearly blackin Tigrett, Tennessee where it burned into a matzo’s twin.

For years there’d been a fired-up congregation so seething, neighborhoods they marched through ignitedno matter their intention; just as natural as summer.There were hot links as active as telephone lineswhose poles mark the countryside as if the nation is helplesswithout a crucifix every few yards; pity they are combustible and that fire itself is holy, that its smoke merges with atmosphere,that we breathe its residue, that when it is thick and black enoughto believe in, it betrays and chokes us; pitythat it is the vehicle that proves the coming of the Lord,the establishment of his kingdom, his superiority becausefire that maintains him disfigures us; when we try to embracehim; we find ourselves out on a limb    burning.  The meal tastes divine, simply divineand I eat it in the presence of a companion dark as scab,as if skin burned off was replaced as he healedwith this total-body scab under which he is pink as a pig, unclean at leastthrough Malachi.

Gatekeepers,"1.A crow gliding over a ravine wasThe sign his eyes were waiting for.They thought they were ready to cross.The tumbleweed listening to a cricketAnd seeing a line of ants snaking inWas the figure of his younger sister,Huddled by him, asking for a campfire.They made it as far as a roadside storeAnd held their hands over the electric coils.When asked if they were going to buy anything,Their tongues broke off into halvesAnd fell to the floor like Popsicles.2.My father says I was born to translateWhat he could only nod to for years.He also says that God made a mistakeBy blurring out his eyes first becauseHe can hear her asking for a blanket.She saw a church adorned with hipbones,Sun-bleached, and beautiful as curved jewelry.She dreamt of its wide doors, and after dippingHer finger in His palm, she felt His warmth.My father says that cactus needles flyAnd burn like the memory of lost ones,Then he tells me I was born to studyThe sand trails and notice when footstepsDrag and turn to knee and handprints.Those are ones I need to follow, he says.",Juan Delgado,Fear
A Song,"Oh, Love, he went a-straying, A long time ago! I missed him in the Maying, When blossoms were of snow; So back I came by the old sweet way; And for I loved him so, wept that he came not with me, A long time ago! Wide open stood my chamber door, And one stepped forth to greet; Gray Grief, strange Grief, who turned me sore With words he spake so sweet. I gave him meat; I gave him drink; (And listened for Love’s feet.) How many years? I cannot think; In truth, I do not know— Ah, long time ago! Oh, love, he came not back again, Although I kept me fair; And each white May, in field and lane, I waited for him there! Yea, he forgot; but Grief stayed on, And in Love’s empty chair Doth sit and tell of days long gone— ’Tis more than I can bear!",Lizette Woodworth Reese,Surprise

The Highland,"—Zelda Fitzgerald, 1939Dear One,Do you have the time? Can you takethe time? Can you makethe time?To visit me? The hospital doors have opened to spring,and its land is high, dear one, each slopewith a vapor of crocuses. Its citizens, alas,are low. Despondent, in fact, though a jar of sun teatans on the sill. The woman beside mehas opened the gift of a china doll, an antiqueFrozen Charlotte. Glass face, a cap of china hair,shellacked to the sheen of a chestnut.At breakfast the shifting returned, dreadfulwithin me: colors were infinite, part of the air . . .lines were free of the masses they held. The melon,a cloud; and the melon, an empty,oval lariat.They have moved the canvas chairfrom the window. Sun, enhancedby the brewing jar, threwan apricot scorch on the fabric. The fruit,a cloud. The fruit,a doll-sized, empty lariat.D. O., into what shapewill our shaplessness flow?    Dear One,Italian escapes me. Still, I float to the operasof Hasse and Handel, a word now and thenlifting through . . .  sole, libertà. In an earlier time,the thrum-plumped voice of a countertenor—half male,half female—might place himamong us, we who are thickenedby fracturings. D. O., now and then, my wordsbreak free of the masses they hold.Think of wind, how it barks through the reedsof a dog's throat. How the pungent, meaty stream of itcracks into something like words—but not. I just sitin the sun room then, slumped in my fur and slabber,feeling the wolf begin, back away, then somegreat-jawed, prehistoric otherbegin, back away, then the gill-less,the gilled, then the first pulsed flecksbegin, back away, until only a wind remains,vast and seamless. No earth, no heavens.No rise, no dip. No single flash of syllablethat might be me. Or you.   D. O.,Now a gauze of snow on the crocuses! I woketo its first brilliance—midnight, great moon—and walked through the hallways. The pin-shaped leavesof the potted cosmos threw a netted shadow,and I stopped in its fragile harmony,my arms, bare feet, the folds of my limp gownstriped by such weightless symmetryI might have beenmyself again. Through an open screen doorI saw a patient, drawn out by the brightness perhaps,her naked body a ghastly white, her facea ghastly, frozen white, fixedin a bow-mouthed syncope, like somethingout of time. As we are, D. O., herein the Highland, time's infinite, cyclic now-and-thenone simple flake of consciousnessagainst the heated tongue.   Dear One,My Italian improves:sole, libertà,and Dio, of course, D. O.! (Although Hehas forsaken me.) The tea at the windowgleams like the flank of a chestnut horse. It darkensimperceptibly, as madness does, or dusk.All morning, I held a length of cotton twine—a shaggy, oakum filament—between the jar and brewing sun.We made a budding universe: the solar disc,the glassy globe of reddish sea, the stillnessin the firmament. At last across the cotton twinea smoke began, a little ashless burn, Dio,that flared and died so suddenlyits light has yet to reach me.",Linda Bierds,Fear
Staggerlee wonders,"1I always wonderwhat they think the niggers are doingwhile they, the pink and alabaster pragmatists, are containing Russia  and defining and re-defining and re-aligning China, nobly restraining themselves, meanwhile,from blowing up that earthwhich they have already blasphemed into dung: the gentle, wide-eyed, cheerfulladies, and their men,nostalgic for the noble cause of Vietnam,nostalgic for noble causes,aching, nobly, to wade through the blood of savages—ah—!Uncas shall never leave the reservation, except to purchase whisky at the State Liquor Store.The Panama Canal shall remain forever locked: there is a way around every treaty.We will turn the tides of the restlessCaribbean, the sun will rise, and seton our hotel balconies as we see fit.The natives will have nothing to complain about,indeed, they will begin to be grateful,will be better off than ever before. They will learn to defer gratificationand save up for things, like we do. Oh, yes. They will.We have only to make an offerthey cannot refuse.This flag has been planted on the moon:it will be interesting to see what steps the moon will take to be revenged for this quite breathtaking presumption.This peoplemasturbate in winding sheets. They have hacked their children to pieces. They have never honoured a single treaty made with anyone, anywhere.The walls of their citiesare as foul as their children.No wonder their children come at them with knives.Mad Charlie man's son was one of their children, had got his shit togetherby the time he left kindergarten,and, as for Patty, heiress of all the ages,she had the greatest vacationof any heiress, anywhere:Golly-gee, whillikens, Mom, real guns!and they come with a real big, black funky stud, too: oh, Ma! he's making eyes at me!Oh, noble Duke Wayne, be careful in them happy hunting grounds.They say the only good Indian is a dead Indian,by what I say is, you can't be too careful, you hear?Oh, towering Ronnie Reagan,wise and resigned lover of redwoods, deeply beloved, winning man-child of the yearning Republicfrom diaper to football field to Warner Brothers sound-stages,be thou our grinning, gently phallic, Big Boy of all the ages!   Salt peanuts, salt peanuts, for dear hearts and gentle people,  and cheerful, shining, simple Uncle Sam!   Nigger, read this and run! Now, if you can't read,  run anyhow!   From Manifest Destiny (Cortez, and all his men silent upon a peak in Darien) to A Decent Interval, and the chopper rises above Saigon, abandoning the noble cause and the people we have made ignoble and whom we leave there, now, to die,  one moves, With All Deliberate Speed, to the South China Sea, and beyond,  where millions of new niggers await glad tidings!    No, said the Great Man's Lady, I'm against abortion, I always feel that's killing somebody. Well, what about capital punishment? I think the death penalty helps.   That's right. Up to our ass in niggers on Death Row.   Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me!    2Well, I guess what the niggers  is supposed to be doing is putting themselves in the path  of that old sweet chariot and have it swing down and carry us home.   That would help, as they say, and they got ways of sort of nudging the chariot. They still got influence with Wind and Water, though they in for some surprises with Cloud and Fire.   My days are not their days. My ways are not their ways. I would not think of them, one way or the other, did not they so grotesquely block the view between me and my brother.   And, so, I always wonder: can blindness be desired? Then, what must the blinded eyes have seen to wish to see no more!   For, I have seen,  in the eyes regarding me,  or regarding my brother,  have seen, deep in the farthest valley of the eye, have seen a flame leap up, then flicker and go out, have seen a veil come down, leaving myself, and the other, alone in that cave which every soul remembers, and out of which, desperately afraid,  I turn, turn, stagger, stumble out,  into the healing air, fall flat on the healing ground,  singing praises, counselling my heart, my soul, to praise.   What is it that this people cannot forget?   Surely, they cannot be deluded as to imagine that their crimes are original?   There is nothing in the least original about the fiery tongs to the eyeballs, the sex torn from the socket, the infant ripped from the womb,  the brains dashed out against rock, nothing original about Judas, or Peter, or you or me: nothing: we are liars and cowards all, or nearly all, or nearly all the time: for we also ride the lightning, answer the thunder, penetrate whirlwinds, curl up on the floor of the sun, and pick our teeth with thunderbolts.   Then, perhaps they imagine that their crimes are not crimes?    Perhaps. Perhaps that is why they cannot repent,  why there is no possibility of repentance. Manifest Destiny is a hymn to madness,  feeding on itself, ending (when it ends) in madness:  the action is blindness and pain, pain bringing a torpor so deep  that every act is willed, is desperately forced, is willed to be a blow:  the hand becomes a fist, the prick becomes a club,  the womb a dangerous swamp, the hope, and fear, of love is acid in the marrow of the bone.  No, their fire is not quenched,  nor can be: the oil feeding the flames being the unadmitted terror of the wrath of God.    Yes. But let us put it in another,  less theological way:  though theology has absolutely nothing to do  with what I am trying to say. But the moment God is mentioned theology is summoned to buttress or demolish belief: an exercise which renders belief irrelevant and adds to the despair of Fifth Avenue  on any afternoon,  the people moving, homeless, through the city, praying to find sanctuary before the sky  and the towers come tumbling down,  before the earth opens, as it does in Superman. They know that no one will appear to turn back time,  they know it, just as they know that the earth has opened before  and will open again, just as they know that their empire is falling, is doomed, nothing can hold it up, nothing. We are not talking about belief.   3  I wonder how they thinkthe niggers made, make it,  how come the niggers are still here.  But, then, again, I don't think they dare to think of that: no:  I'm fairly certain they don't think of that at all.   Lord,  I with the alabaster lady of the house,  with Beulah. Beulah about sixty, built in four-square,  biceps like Mohammed Ali, she at the stove, fixing biscuits,  scrambling eggs and bacon, fixing coffee,  pouring juice, and the lady of the house, she say, she don't know how  she'd get along without Beulah and Beulah just silently grunts, I reckon you don't, and keeps on keeping on and the lady of the house say She's just like one of the family, and Beulah turns, gives me a look,  sucks her teeth and rolls her eyes in the direction of the lady's back, and keeps on keeping on.    While they are containing  Russia and entering onto the quicksand of  China and patronizing Africa,  and calculating the Caribbean plunder, and the South China Sea booty,  the niggers are aware that no one has discussed  anything at all with the niggers.    Well. Niggers don't own nothing, got no flag, even our names  are hand-me-downs and you don't change that  by calling yourself X: sometimes that just makes it worse,  like obliterating the path that leads back to whence you came, and  to where you can begin.  And, anyway, none of this changes the reality,  which is, for example, that I do not want my son  to die in Guantanamo,  or anywhere else, for that matter,  serving the Stars and Stripes.  (I've seen some stars. I got some stripes.)    Neither (incidentally) has anyone discussed the Bomb with the niggers: the incoherent feeling is, the less the nigger knows about the Bomb, the better:  the lady of the house smiles nervously in your direction as though she had just been overheard discussing family, or sexual secrets,  and changes the subject to Education,  or Full Employment, or the Welfare rolls,  the smile saying, Don't be dismayed.  We know how you feel. You can trust us.   Yeah. I would like to believe you. But we are not talking about belief.  4The sons of greed, the heirs of plunder,  are approaching the end of their journey:  it is amazing that they approach without wonder,  as though they have, themselves, become that scorched and blasphemed earth,  the stricken buffalo, the slaughtered tribes,  the endless, virgin, bloodsoaked plain, the famine, the silence, the children's eyes,  murder masquerading as salvation, seducing every democratic eye, the mouths of truth and anguish choked with cotton,  rape delirious with the fragrance of magnolia, the hacking of the fruit of their loins to pieces,   hey! the tar-baby sons and nephews, the high-yaller     nieces,and Tom's black prick hacked offto rustle in crinoline,  to hang, heaviest of heirlooms, between the pink and alabaster breasts of the Great Man's Lady, or worked into the sash at the waist of the high-yaller Creole bitch, or niece, a chunk of shining brown-black satin, staring, staring, like the single eye of God:   creation yearns to re-create a time when we were able to recognize a crime.    Alas,  my stricken kinsmen,  the party is over:  there have never been any white people,  anywhere: the trick was accomplished with mirrors— look: where is your image now?  where your inheritance,  on what rock stands this pride?   Oh,  I counsel you,  leave History alone. She is exhausted,  sitting, staring into her dressing-room mirror, and wondering what rabbit, now,  to pull out of what hat,  and seriously considering retirement,  even though she knows her public dare not let her go.   She must change.  Yes. History must change.  A slow, syncopated relentless music begins suggesting her re-entry, transformed, virginal as she was, in the Beginning, untouched,  as the Word was spoken,  before the rape which debased her to be the whore of multitudes, or,  as one might say, before she became the Star,  whose name, above our title,  carries the Show, making History the patsy, responsible for every flubbed line,  every missed cue, responsible for the life and death, of all bright illusions and dark delusions, Lord, History is weary of her unspeakable liaison with Time,  for Time and History have never seen eye to eye:  Time laughs at History and time and time and time again Time traps History in a lie.   But we always, somehow, managed to roar History back onstage to take another bow, to justify, to sanctify the journey until now.    Time warned us to ask for our money back,  and disagreed with History as concerns colours white and black. Not only do we come from further back, but the light of the Sun marries all colours as one.    Kinsmen,  I have seen you betray your Saviour (it is you who call Him Saviour)  so many times, and I have spoken to Him about you,  behind your back.  Quite a lot has been going on  behind your back, and,  if your phone has not yet been disconnected,  it will soon begin to ring:  informing you, for example, that a whole generation,  in Africa, is about to die,  and a new generation is about to rise, and will not need your bribes,  or your persuasions, any more:  not your morality. No plundered gold— Ah! Kinsmen, if I could make you see the crime is not what you have done to me! It is you who are blind,  you, bowed down with chains,  you, whose children mock you, and seek another  master, you, who cannot look man or woman or child in the  eye, whose sleep is blank with terror,  for whom love died long ago, somewhere between the airport and the safe-deposit box, the buying and selling of rising or falling stocks,  you, who miss Zanzibar and Madagascar and Kilimanjaro and lions and tigers and elephants and zebras  and flying fish and crocodiles and alligators and leopards and crashing waterfalls and endless rivers,  flowers fresher than Eden, silence sweeter than the  grace of God, passion at every turning, throbbing in the bush,  thicker, oh, than honey in the hive,  dripping dripping opening, welcoming, aching from toe to bottom to spine,  sweet heaven on the line to last forever, yes,  but, now,  rejoicing ends, man, a price remains to pay,  your innocence costs too much and we can't carry you on our books or our backs, any longer: baby, find another Eden, another apple tree, somewhere, if you can,  and find some other natives, somewhere else, to listen to you bellow till you come, just like a man,  but we don't need you, are sick of being a fantasy to feed you,  and of being the principal accomplice to your crime:  for, it is your crime, now, the cross to which you cling,  your Alpha and Omega for everything.    Well (others have told you) your clown's grown weary, the puppet master is bored speechless with this monotonous disaster,  and is long gone, does not belong to you,  any more than my woman, or my child,  ever belonged to you.    During this long travail our ancestors spoke to us, and we listened,  and we tried to make you hear life in our song but now it matters not at all to me  whether you know what I am talking about—or not: I know why we are not blinded by your brightness, are able to see you,  who cannot see us. I know  why we are still here.    Godspeed.  The niggers are calculating,  from day to day, life everlasting,  and wish you well:  but decline to imitate the Son of the Morning,  and rule in Hell.",James Baldwin,Love

The College Colonel,"He rides at their head;     A crutch by his saddle just slants in view, One slung arm is in splints, you see,     Yet he guides his strong steed—how coldly too.   He brings his regiment home—     Not as they filed two years before, But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn, Like castaway sailors, who—stunned           By the surf’s loud roar,     Their mates dragged back and seen no more— Again and again breast the surge,     And at last crawl, spent, to shore.   A still rigidity and pale—     An Indian aloofness lones his brow; He has lived a thousand years Compressed in battle’s pains and prayers,     Marches and watches slow. There are welcoming shouts, and flags;     Old men off hat to the Boy, Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet,     But to him—there comes alloy.   It is not that a leg is lost,     It is not that an arm is maimed, It is not that the fever has racked—     Self he has long disclaimed.   But all through the Seven Days’ Fight,     And deep in the Wilderness grim, And in the field-hospital tent,     And Petersburg crater, and dim Lean brooding in Libby, there came—     Ah heaven!—what truth to him.",Herman Melville,Surprise
The Gardener 38,"My love, once upon a time your poet launched a great epic in his mind.Alas, I was not careful, and it struck your ringing anklets and came to grief.It broke up into scraps of songs and lay scattered at your feet.All my cargo of the stories of old wars was tossed by the laughing waves and soaked in tears and sank.You must make this loss good to me, my love.If my claims to immortal fame after death are shattered, make me immortal while I live.And I will not mourn for my loss nor blame you.",Rabindranath Tagore,Sadness
Tide of Voices,"At the hour the streetlights come on, buildingsturn abstract. The Hudson, for a moment, formal.   We drink bourbon on the terrace and you speakin the evening voice, weighted deep in the throat.They plan to harvest oysters, you tell me,from the harbor by Jersey City, how the waterswill be clean again in twenty years. I imagine netsburdened with rough shells, the meat dun and sexual.Below, the river and the high rockwhere boys each year jump from bravadoor desperation. The day flares, turns into itself.And innocently, sideways, the way we always fallinto grace or knowledge, we watched the policedrag the river for a suicide, the third this year.   The terrible hook, the boy’s frail whiteness.His face was blank and new as your facein the morning before the day has workedits pattern of lines and tensions. A hooklike an iron question and this comingout of the waters, a flawed pearl—a memory that wasn’t ours to claim.   Perhaps, in a bedroom by lamplight,   a woman waits for this boy. She may riffle drawersgathering photographs, string, keys to abandoned rooms.Even now she may be leaving,   closing the door for some silence. I needto move next to you. Water sluicedfrom the boy’s hair. I need to watch youlight your cigarette, the flickeringof your face in matchlight, as if underwater,drifting away.

The wall sweated   behind the headboard and you said you feltthe rim where dreams crouchand every room of the past. It must begin in luxury—do you think—a break and fall into the glamourattending each kind of surrender. Water must floodthe mind, as in certain diseases, the wallsbetween the cells of memory dissolve, blurinto a single stream of voices and faces.

Rarefied,"This sweater is made from only the finest, softest underhairs of the Mongolian camel.“Fancy-schmancy,” my father would have said,   whose snazziest sweater was still a declassé   synthetic from the sweatshops of Taiwan. My friend   Deloris, however, who really owns such clothes,   would say “exquisite” or “sublime”—her opened closet’s   row of shoulders teases late-day bedroomlight   along such textures, there are days when the laboring brain   and throbbing crotch appear to us to be not much more   than her wardrobe’s tasteful accessories. “. . . woven   from genital-down of prepubescent yeti, and then   hand-sewn in our undersea domes.” “Untouched   by anyone other than albino elves, this wool is . . . .”______________Rarefied—to Helthi Hart, the diet guru, it’s   a cup of clear organic cauliflower broth. And for   the Emperor Excessia, it’s a mad dessert of swans’ tongues   —there were, what? ten thousand?—dipped in a slip   of stiffening honey and set out to await the banqueteers   like a field of fresh shoots they could graze.   Some Roman party hosts had great roped bowls of snow   brought from the mountaintops to entertain their guests   with dishes of rose-petal sherbet and chilled roe.   They might even allow the household slaves to slide   leftover snow along the burning welts the ropes ate   into their shoulders all down the mountainside.   ______________   Afterwards it was an unrecognizable tatter.   But an image of my father’s worn-thin Bargain City   “all-weather” jacket is still whole in its polyester glory.   This is what happened: the alley dog (he later called the thing   a “cur”) had cornered Livia, and she screamed once,   with a seven-year-old’s unselfconscious terror.   And then my father was there, with his jacket wound around his arm,   and a rock. When it was over, he tore the sleeves off, tied the poor dog   quiet and, after comforting Livia, they both kneeled down   to comfort the dog. He was like that. And the jacket   that served as weapon and restraint?—was like him,   every day of his life. It did what was needed.   ______________I misread “migraine.” Which of the two   would we call the most rarefied? “Margarine”?   Or maybe comparison isn’t the point. A ghost   is a person rarefied through the fine, fine colander   death; that doesn’t make, for most of us, extinction   an ideal. It was hard to think of Frank and Deloris   divorcing, since it was hard to imagine the two of them   engaging in anything so mundane as sex or rage or envy   with the rest of the hoi polloi. They seemed unearthly   in close to a literal way, like radio waves. And yet divorcethey did. They found something real they could unjoin,   hertz from hertz until there just was air.   ______________A dream: We own the softest of the soft   Mongolian camel underhair sweaters. One day   (we think we’re doing the “right thing”) we release it   into the wild, to romp with its brother and sister   desert sweaters, out where it “belongs.”You know, however, what happens by now: it’s unfit   to fend for itself amid that hardened herd.   They beat it. It’s hungry. It crawls back   into the city, mewing, curling up at night against a door   my father opens and, seeing something in need, brings it inside,   wraps it in flannel. That’s how he was.   He’d give you the cheap shirt off his back.",Albert Goldbarth,Joy

"To Mary Sidney, On Reading Her Psalms","You give me a little courage, Mary,in your skittish dedication to her highness;I too can dare as humbleness may dare;if there’s anywhere to speak with you, it’s hereat the wordy Anglo-Saxon peripheryof the universe’s one great surge of praise though I’m lost here. Where’s the joyful noise?the syllables I managed to memorizebefore they were weighted down by meaning?and what’s all this complicated rhyme?Don’t mistake me—I’m not complaining;it’s just not my notion of a psalm for all my love of wrought, elaborate things—especially when they’re the sort that singsand yours do sing a stunning song—but they’re off-kilter without the aweinherent in my ancient holy tongue.I miss my amen sela, hallelujah though I do applaud you and your brother—going for the full linguistic bait-and-switchin the move from one language to another:David’s disarmingly direct speecha tour-de-force of formal contrivance(no form repeated more than once in each of a hundred fifty psalms!)in your show-off/virtuoso hands.Talk about such a song in such a land—but what else is there in dreary England?Its sole extravagance a trove of synonymsthat endlessly perplexes and expands its mongrel, unbeautiful tongue—a language, frankly, crying out for poetrygiven its absence, even, of integritynot to mention intrinsic song. . . .(Its sound: water going down the drainaccording to my friend, an Italian, after riding in a compartment of Americansgurgling all the way from Florence to Rome.)Why not a convoluted schemeof intricately wrought meter and rhyme?So what if the Hebrew has no strict patterns?Aim for a parallel sublime; aren’t poems for the impossible?Though perhaps yours wouldn’t have been writtenhad you known how daunting their task was;you had no Hebrew, used the Coverdale,Wyatt, Geneva Bible, as cribs for Latin,even psaumes de David, mis en rime Françoise . . . Clearly, your secret weapon was ignorance,also useful (look at me!) in writing a poem,your psalms fourth- and fifth-hand half the time.Unless (of course!) your stroke of brilliancewas to focus on the one thing you could do:Sing and let your song be new which they are, profoundly, even to me,who know so many bits of the originalsof what you claim you’re “translating” by heart.Still, I’ll be reading along, alternatelyput off and spellbound by your art-ifice, when my wary eye suddenly falls on something both completely known and new,my own—our own—ungainly languagefor a brief instant alien with grace,a black-on-white typescript miragein which English letters turn into Hebrewor at least intercept its holiness. . . . How did you manage it, Mary?Your contemporaries called it piety—but I don’t believe that for a second.What motivated you was love of poetry,or rather of your legendarybrother—lost so young—whom you would spend your whole life working to immortalize. . . .I’m not sure he needed you. No lighter touchexists in English poetry than his . . .a touch you often managed to approachin your grief-induced lyric resolveto force a bit of him to stay alive. Poetry as solace, as wizardry—and there he is, with you, all the time,clearly palpable in all your artistry.It was your eagerness to be with himthat kept you going back to intervenewith yet one more indomitable line, got you through all hundred-fifty psalms.Or maybe it was just your poet’s ruse(poetry often thrives on self-delusion)to trick yourself to rise to his occasion. . . .Unless he just provided the excuseto stake your own (quite vast) poetic claims, impossible to say from this vantage point:to distinguish collaborator from muse,self-doubt from false humilitybut, then again, there’s a poetry in mystery.Who will contradict me if I confusemy own passions with yours—so convenient, inevitable?—in a poem like this—though you and I—despite the labyrinthof misapprehension, class, religionreinforcing our dissociation(Jew from Christian, commoner from countess,twenty-first-century from seventeenth) come together in passion upon passion(forgive me, Mary, if dare too far):psalms, poetic forms, your genius brother(I mean both the poet and the man;no poem could manufacture that much charm).We’ve even suffered from a kindred harm: my version, albeit, fairly mild,though I too was admonished as a childabout what a woman dared not do.Still, I have a vast cohort, while youwere almost entirely alone.Better yet, I had the complete Dickinson (published just a year before I was born);I didn’t know it yet, but I had you . . .while you had to ransack antiquityfor even fragments of poems by a woman.But of course you weren’t troubled by inequity—it was, frankly, all you knew— you might even have relished your positionas sole woman poet, thinker, patron—lonely as it was—though you did encourageyour precocious niece, Mary (later Wroth).And who can really estimate the damageof your appalling bargain: a brother’s death required to turn you into poet?Of course, in your time, death was everywhere.Perhaps you were pious—a last resortto shore up an attenuated heartagainst even further disrepair,immersion in the psalms a sort of antidote to life’s massive overdose of pain:from living with a sad, disfigured mother(small-pox scars from nursing a sick queen)mourning her husband’s lost affectionto deaths of favorites—your sister, your brother,your only daughters, Katherine, then Anne. God made this day; he did us send itIn joy and mirth then let us spend itExcellent advice, if it would hold—And maybe it does, when you can summonall that air or life enfoldto distract you with a binge of exaltation . . . or if that fails, then an assiduousextravaganza of sublime detailcalibrated to provide the wherewithalto face a universe we cannot alterif not with joy and mirth, at least with grace:a perfect, hand-illuminated psalter, the loops of all its letters filled with gold—a treasure, even, for an exacting Queen—offering a deity who’ll listento a voice alternately humble, bold,beseeching, thankful, ecstatic, bleak,through which (hallelujah, Mary!) you still speak.",Jacqueline Osherow,Joy

The Little Orphan,"The crowded street his playground is, a patch of blue his sky; A puddle in a vacant lot his sea where ships pass by: Poor little orphan boy of five, the city smoke and grime Taint every cooling breeze he gets throughout the summer time; And he is just as your boy is, a child who loves to play, Except that he is drawn and white and cannot get away. And he would like the open fields, for often in his dreams The angels kind bear him off to where are pleasant streams, Where he may sail a splendid boat, sometimes he flies a kite, Or romps beside a shepherd dog and shouts with all his might; But when the dawn of morning comes he wakes to find once more That what he thought were sun-kissed hills are rags upon the floor. Then through the hot and sultry day he plays at “make-pretend,” The alley is a sandy beach where all the rich folks send Their little boys and girls to play, a barrel is his boat, But, oh, the air is tifling and the dust fills up his throat; And though he tries so very hard to play, somehow it seems He never gets such wondrous joys as angels bring in dreams. Poor little orphan boy of five, except that he is pale, With sunken cheeks and hollow eyes and very wan and frail, Just like that little boy of yours, with same desire to play, Fond of the open fields and skies, he’s built the self-same way; But kept by fate and circumstance away from shady streams, His only joy comes when he sleeps and angels bring him dreams.",Edgar Albert Guest,Joy

Attack,"At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun In the wild purple of the glow'ring sun, Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud The menacing scarred slope; and, one by one, Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire. The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear, Men jostle and climb to, meet the bristling fire. Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear, They leave their trenches, going over the top, While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists, And hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists, Flounders in mud. O Jesus, make it stop!",Siegfried Sassoon,Fear
Portrait of a Figure near Water,"Rebuked, she turned and ranuphill to the barn. Anger, the inner   arsonist, held a match to her brain.   She observed her life: against her will   it survived the unwavering flame.The barn was empty of animals.   Only a swallow tiltednear the beams, and batshung from the raftersthe roof sagged between.Her breath became steadywhere, years past, the farmer cooled   the big tin amphoræ of milk.The stone trough was stillfilled with water: she watched it   and received its calm.So it is when we retreat in anger:   we think we burn aloneand there is no balm.Then water enters, though it makes   no sound.",Jane Kenyon,Fear
A Variation on Machado,I worry much about the sufferingof Machado. I was only one when he carriedhis mother across the border from Spain to Francein a rainstorm. She died and so did hea few days later in a rooming house along a dry canal.To carry Mother he abandoned a satchelholding his last few years of poetry.I've traveled to Collioure several timesto search for Machado's lost satchel.The French fed him but couldn't save him.There's no true path to a death —we discover the path by walking.We turn a corner on no roadand there's a house on a green hillwith a thousand colorful birds sweeping in a circle.Are the poems in the basement of the house on the hill?We'll find out if we remember earth at all.,Jim Harrison,Fear
To My Old City,"You’re still there in the spectral impress,   the plied afterimage grid of trucksand buses, diesel fume and bloodspoor streaked   on wet streets, and cars biting evening papersfrom the black newsstand. Above, the trestle’s   gravel bed hums expectantly, or with relief,and the gritty pinpoints of snow, at rest   on silver rails, flare into the coming dark,while everywhere your hungry light still tries   to reconstruct itself, charm the spacein and around the looseknit ironworks,   winter’s checkered yellowings glaring pastthe dark. From here, two years away, I see   in your middle distance a trestle stretchedbetween two brownstones, the whole scene   droning deep: the train tears through the gap,ratcheting the space with green aquatic squares   that flick past like old sluggish film,each frame a piece of failing, played-back fact,   and the unseen wheels click, mumble, clickin flukes of young clean snow fountaining up   around those strangers abiding in the glass.",W.

Mingus in Diaspora,"You could say, I suppose, that he ate his way out,like the prisoner who starts a tunnel with a spoon,or you could say he was one in whom nothing was lost,who took it all in, or that he was big as a bus.He would say, and he did, in one of those blurredmelismatic slaloms his sentences ran—for allthe music was in his speech: swift switches of tempo,stop-time, double time (he could talk in 6/8),“I just ruined my body.” And there, Exhibit A,it stood, that Parthenon of fat, the tenant voicelifted, as we say, since words are a weight, and music.Silence is lighter than air, for the air we knowrises but to the edge of the atmosphere.You have to pick up The Bass, as Mingus calledhis, with audible capitals, and think of the slow yearsthe wood spent as a tree, which might well have beenenough for wood, and think of the skill the bassmakercarried without great thought of it from hometo the shop and back for decades, and knowwhat bassists before you have played, and knowhow much of this is stored in The Bass like energyin a spring and know how much you must coax out.How easy it would be, instead, to pull a swordfrom a stone. But what’s inside the bass wants out,the way one day you will. Religious stories are richin symmetry.

Man of War,"After there were no women, men, and children, from the somber deeps horseshoe crabs crawled up on somber shores: Man-of-Wars' blue sails drifted downwind and blue filaments of some biblical cloak floated below: the stinging filaments.

Our Family Tree,"On the death of my sister Cecilia—the last of five members of the family, who died successively.Our family tree is in the sear And yellow leaf of life;Branch after branch, year after year, Yields to death’s pruning knife.First, youngest born, as if ’twere meet, The sacrifice should be,“The last of earth,” the first to meet Th’ unknown eternity.’Twas God who gave, ’twas He who took, His voice let us obey,So that in his eternal book, Our names shine bright as day.",Joseph Cephas Holly,Joy

To the Poet Before Battle,"Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes; Thy lovely things must all be laid away; And thou, as others, must face the riven day Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums, Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway, Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs Of praise the little versemen joyed to take Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are, For all our skill in words, equal in might And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make The name of poet terrible in just war, And like a crown of honour upon the fight.",Ivor Gurney,Sadness

The sun above the mountain's head, A freshening lustre mellow Through all the long green fields has spread, His first sweet evening yellow. Books! 'tis a dull and endless strife: Come, hear the woodland linnet, How sweet his music! on my life, There's more of wisdom in it. And hark! how blithe the throstle sings! He, too, is no mean preacher: Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher. She has a world of ready wealth, Our minds and hearts to bless— Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health, Truth breathed by cheerfulness. One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can. Sweet is the lore which Nature brings; Our meddling intellect Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:— We murder to dissect. Enough of Science and of Art; Close up those barren leaves; Come forth, and bring with you a heart That watches and receives.",William Wordsworth,Sadness

from Epipsychidion,"Emily, A ship is floating in the harbour now, A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow; There is a path on the sea's azure floor, No keel has ever plough'd that path before; The halcyons brood around the foamless isles; The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles; The merry mariners are bold and free: Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me? Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest Is a far Eden of the purple East; And we between her wings will sit, while Night, And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight, Our ministers, along the boundless Sea, Treading each other's heels, unheededly. It is an isle under Ionian skies, Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise, And, for the harbours are not safe and good, This land would have remain'd a solitude But for some pastoral people native there, Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air Draw the last spirit of the age of gold, Simple and spirited; innocent and bold. The blue Aegean girds this chosen home, With ever-changing sound and light and foam, Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar; And all the winds wandering along the shore Undulate with the undulating tide: There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide; And many a fountain, rivulet and pond, As clear as elemental diamond, Or serene morning air; and far beyond, The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer (Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year) Pierce into glades, caverns and bowers, and halls Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls Illumining, with sound that never fails Accompany the noonday nightingales; And all the place is peopled with sweet airs; The light clear element which the isle wears Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers, Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers, And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep; And from the moss violets and jonquils peep And dart their arrowy odour through the brain Till you might faint with that delicious pain. And every motion, odour, beam and tone, With that deep music is in unison: Which is a soul within the soul—they seem Like echoes of an antenatal dream. It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth and Sea, Cradled and hung in clear tranquillity; Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer, Wash'd by the soft blue Oceans of young air. It is a favour'd place. Famine or Blight, Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they Sail onward far upon their fatal way: The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew, From which its fields and woods ever renew Their green and golden immortality. And from the sea there rise, and from the sky There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright, Veil after veil, each hiding some delight, Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside, Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride Glowing at once with love and loveliness, Blushes and trembles at its own excess: Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less Burns in the heart of this delicious isle, An atom of th' Eternal, whose own smile Unfolds itself, and may be felt not seen O'er the gray rocks, blue waves and forests green, Filling their bare and void interstices. But the chief marvel of the wilderness Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how None of the rustic island-people know: 'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height It overtops the woods; but, for delight, Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime Had been invented, in the world's young prime, Rear'd it, a wonder of that simple time, An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house Made sacred to his sister and his spouse. It scarce seems now a wreck of human art, But, as it were, Titanic; in the heart Of Earth having assum'd its form, then grown Out of the mountains, from the living stone, Lifting itself in caverns light and high: For all the antique and learned imagery Has been eras'd, and in the place of it The ivy and the wild-vine interknit The volumes of their many-twining stems; Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen, Or fragments of the day's intense serene; Working mosaic on their Parian floors. And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem To sleep in one another's arms, and dream Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we Read in their smiles, and call reality.        This isle and house are mine, and I have vow'd Thee to be lady of the solitude. And I have fitted up some chambers there Looking towards the golden Eastern air, And level with the living winds, which flow Like waves above the living waves below. I have sent books and music there, and all Those instruments with which high Spirits call The future from its cradle, and the past Out of its grave, and make the present last In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die, Folded within their own eternity. Our simple life wants little, and true taste Hires not the pale drudge Luxury to waste The scene it would adorn, and therefore still, Nature with all her children haunts the hill. The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance Between the quick bats in their twilight dance; The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight Before our gate, and the slow, silent night Is measur'd by the pants of their calm sleep. Be this our home in life, and when years heap Their wither'd hours, like leaves, on our decay, Let us become the overhanging day, The living soul of this Elysian isle, Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile We two will rise, and sit, and walk together, Under the roof of blue Ionian weather, And wander in the meadows, or ascend The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend With lightest winds, to touch their paramour; Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore, Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea, Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy— Possessing and possess'd by all that is Within that calm circumference of bliss, And by each other, till to love and live Be one: or, at the noontide hour, arrive Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep The moonlight of the expir'd night asleep, Through which the awaken'd day can never peep; A veil for our seclusion, close as night's, Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights; Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again. And we will talk, until thought's melody Become too sweet for utterance, and it die In words, to live again in looks, which dart With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart, Harmonizing silence without a sound. Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound, And our veins beat together; and our lips With other eloquence than words, eclipse The soul that burns between them, and the wells Which boil under our being's inmost cells, The fountains of our deepest life, shall be Confus'd in Passion's golden purity, As mountain-springs under the morning sun. We shall become the same, we shall be one Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two? One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew, Till like two meteors of expanding flame, Those spheres instinct with it become the same, Touch, mingle, are transfigur'd; ever still Burning, yet ever inconsumable: In one another's substance finding food, Like flames too pure and light and unimbu'd To nourish their bright lives with baser prey, Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away: One hope within two wills, one will beneath Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death, One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality, And one annihilation.

God's Judgment on a Wicked Bishop,"The summer and autumn had been so wet,That in winter the corn was growing yet,'Twas a piteous sight to see all aroundThe grain lie rotting on the ground.Every day the starving poorCrowded around Bishop Hatto's door,For he had a plentiful last-year's store,And all the neighbourhood could tellHis granaries were furnish'd well.At last Bishop Hatto appointed a dayTo quiet the poor without delay;He bade them to his great Barn repair,And they should have food for the winter there.Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,The poor folk flock'd from far and near;The great barn was full as it could holdOf women and children, and young and old.Then when he saw it could hold no more,Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;And while for mercy on Christ they call,He set fire to the Barn and burnt them all.""I'faith 'tis an excellent bonfire!"" quoth he,""And the country is greatly obliged to me,For ridding it in these times forlornOf Rats that only consume the corn.""So then to his palace returned he,And he sat down to supper merrily,And he slept that night like an innocent man;But Bishop Hatto never slept again.In the morning as he enter'd the hallWhere his picture hung against the wall,A sweat like death all over him came,For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame.As he look'd there came a man from his farm—He had a countenance white with alarm;""My Lord, I open'd your granaries this morn,And the Rats had eaten all your corn.""Another came running presently,And he was pale as pale could be,""Fly! my Lord Bishop, fly,"" quoth he,""Ten thousand Rats are coming this way,...The Lord forgive you for yesterday!""""I'll go to my tower on the Rhine,"" replied he,""'Tis the safest place in Germany;The walls are high and the shores are steep,And the stream is strong and the water deep.""Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away,And he crost the Rhine without delay,And reach'd his tower, and barr'd with careAll the windows, doors, and loop-holes there.He laid him down and closed his eyes;...But soon a scream made him arise,He started and saw two eyes of flameOn his pillow from whence the screaming came.He listen'd and look'd;... it was only the Cat;And the Bishop he grew more fearful for that,For she sat screaming, mad with fearAt the Army of Rats that were drawing near.For they have swum over the river so deep,And they have climb'd the shores so steep,And up the Tower their way is bent,To do the work for which they were sent.They are not to be told by the dozen or score,By thousands they come, and by myriads and more,Such numbers had never been heard of before,Such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore.Down on his knees the Bishop fell,And faster and faster his beads did he tell,As louder and louder drawing nearThe gnawing of their teeth he could hear.And in at the windows and in at the door,And through the walls helter-skelter they pour,And down from the ceiling and up through the floor,From the right and the left, from behind and before,From within and without, from above and below,And all at once to the Bishop they go.They have whetted their teeth against the stones,And now they pick the Bishop's bones:They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,For they were sent to do judgment on him!",Robert Southey,Sadness

Wherever one is from,Whoever this man is.And he is always there. Everybody knows one.He always makes his big lasso, twirling his rope   Around himself and a woman from the audienceOnly I am the woman, do you understand, Anselmo?   Caught in the circling rope.

The Introduction,"Did I, my lines intend for public view,How many censures, would their faults pursue,Some would, because such words they do affect,Cry they’re insipid, empty, and uncorrect.And many have attained, dull and untaught,The name of wit only by finding fault.True judges might condemn their want of wit,And all might say, they’re by a woman writ.Alas! a woman that attempts the pen,Such an intruder on the rights of men,Such a presumptuous creature, is esteemed,The fault can by no virtue be redeemed.They tell us we mistake our sex and way;Good breeding, fashion, dancing, dressing, playAre the accomplishments we should desire;To write, or read, or think, or to inquireWould cloud our beauty, and exhaust our time,And interrupt the conquests of our prime;Whilst the dull manage of a servile houseIs held by some our outmost art, and use.  Sure ’twas not ever thus, nor are we toldFables, of women that excelled of old;To whom, by the diffusive hand of Heaven Some share of wit, and poetry was given.On that glad day, on which the Ark returned,The holy pledge, for which the land had mourned,The joyful tribes, attend it on the way,The Levites do the sacred charge convey,Whilst various instruments, before it play;Here, holy virgins in the concert joinThe louder notes, to soften, and refine,And with alternate verse complete the hymn divine.Lo! the young Poet, after God’s own heart,By Him inspired, and taught the Muses’ art,Returned from conquest, a bright chorus meets,That sing his slain ten thousand in the streets.In such loud numbers they his acts declare,Proclaim the wonders of his early war,That Saul upon the vast applause does frown,And feels its mighty thunder shake the crown.What, can the threatened judgment now prolong?Half of the kingdom is already gone;The fairest half, whose influence guides the rest,Have David’s empire o’er their hearts confessed.  A woman here, leads fainting Israel on,She fights, she wins, she triumphs with a song,Devout, majestic, for the subject fit,And far above her arms, exalts her wit;Then, to the peaceful, shady palm withdraws,And rules the rescued nation, with her laws.How are we fall’n, fall’n by mistaken rules?And education’s, more than nature’s fools,Debarred from all improvements of the mind,And to be dull, expected and designed;And if some one would soar above the rest,With warmer fancy, and ambition pressed,So strong th’ opposing faction still appears,The hopes to thrive can ne’er outweigh the fears,Be cautioned then my Muse, and still retired;Nor be despised, aiming to be admired;Conscious of wants, still with contracted wing,To some few friends, and to thy sorrows sing;For groves of laurel thou wert never meant;Be dark enough thy shades, and be thou there content.",Countess of Winchilsea Anne Finch,Sadness
Rutherford McDowell,"They brought me ambrotypes Of the old pioneers to enlarge. And sometimes one sat for me i Some one who was in being When giant hands from the womb of the world Tore the republic. What was it in their eyes? i For I could never fathom That mystical pathos of drooped eyelids, And the serene sorrow of their eyes. It was like a pool of water, Amid oak trees at the edge of a forest, Where the leaves fall, As you hear the crow of a cock From a far-off farm house, seen near the hills Where the third generation lives, and the strong men And the strong women are gone and forgotten. And these grand-children and great grand-children Of the pioneers! Truly did my camera record their faces, too, With so much of the old strength gone, And the old faith gone, And the old mastery of life gone, And the old courage gone, Which labors and loves and suffers and sings Under the sun!",Edgar Lee Masters,Joy
Paradise Lost: Book 10 (1674 version),"MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act Of Satan done in Paradise, and how Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve, Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, Hinder'd not Satan to attempt the minde Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm'd, Complete to have discover'd and repulst Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. Up into Heav'n from Paradise in haste Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad For Man, for of his state by this they knew, Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare That time Celestial visages, yet mixt With pitie, violated not thir bliss. About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream Accountable made haste to make appear With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, And easily approv'd; when the most High Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth, Which your sincerest care could not prevent, Foretold so lately what would come to pass, When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell. I told ye then he should prevail and speed On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't And flatter'd out of all, believing lies Against his Maker; no Decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his Fall, Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free Will, to her own inclining left In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass On his transgression, Death denounc't that day, Which he presumes already vain and void, Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth, or Hell. Easie it might be seen that I intend Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n. So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full Resplendent all his Father manifest Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. Father Eternal, thine is to decree, Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, When time shall be, for so I undertook Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none Are to behold the Judgment, but the judg'd, Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. Now was the Sun in Western cadence low From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard, And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud. Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: Or come I less conspicuous, or what change Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; Love was not in thir looks, either to God Or to each other, but apparent guilt, And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom The gracious judge without revile repli'd. My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, But still rejoyc't, how is it now become So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd. O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand Before my judge, either to undergoe My self the total Crime, or to accuse My other self, the partner of my life; Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, I should conceal, and not expose to blame By my complaint; but strict necessitie Subdues me, and calamitous constraint Least on my head both sin and punishment, However insupportable, be all Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, That from her hand I could suspect no ill, And what she did, whatever in it self, Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, Superior, or but equal, that to her Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd Shee was indeed, and lovely to attract Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts Were such as under Government well seem'd, Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part And person, had'st thou known thy self aright. So having said, he thus to Eve in few: Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, Confessing soon, yet not before her judge Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. Which when the Lord God heard, without delay To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd Serpent though brute, unable to transferre The Guilt on him who made him instrument Of mischief, and polluted from the end Of his Creation; justly then accurst, As vitiated in Nature: more to know Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field; Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life. Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; Her Seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel. So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht In open shew, and with ascention bright Captivity led captive through the Aire, The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt, Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; Eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife, And eaten of the Tree concerning which I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread, Till thou return unto the ground, for thou Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood Before him naked to the aire, that now Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume, As when he wash'd his servants feet so now As Father of his Familie he clad Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. To him with swift ascent he up returnd, Into his blissful bosom reassum'd In glory as of old, to him appeas'd All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, In counterview within the Gates, that now Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. O Son, why sit we here each other viewing Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides For us his ofspring deare; It cannot be But that success attends him; if mishap, Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n By his Avenger, since no place like this Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, Or sympathie, or som connatural force Powerful at greatest distance to unite With secret amity things of like kinde By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade Inseparable must with mee along: For Death from Sin no power can separate. But least the difficultie of passing back Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe Impassable, Impervious, let us try Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable, to found a path Over this Maine from Hell to that new World Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn By this new felt attraction and instinct. Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. Goe whither Fate and inclination strong Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste The savour of Death from all things there that live: Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, Against the day of Battel, to a Field, Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd With sent of living Carcasses design'd For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr. Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great) Hovering upon the Waters; what they met Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea Tost up and down, together crowded drove From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm As Delos floating once; the rest his look Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall Immovable of this now fenceless world Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. So, if great things to small may be compar'd, Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, From Susa his Memnonian Palace high Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock Over the vext Abyss, following the track Of Satan, to the self same place where hee First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe From out of Chaos to the out side bare Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made And durable; and now in little space The confines met of Empyrean Heav'n And of this World, and on the left hand Hell With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes In sight, to each of these three places led. And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, To Paradise first tending, when behold Satan in likeness of an Angel bright Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. Hee after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought Vain covertures; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them terrifi'd Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood Not instant, but of future time. With joy And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, My Heart, which by a secret harmonie Still moves with thine, join'd in connexion sweet, That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks Now also evidence, but straight I felt Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt That I must after thee with this thy Son; Such fatal consequence unites us three: Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure Detain from following thy illustrious track. Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd Within Hell Gates till, now, thou us impow'rd To fortifie thus farr, and overlay With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World Retiring, by his own doom alienated, And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide Of all things parted by th' Empyreal bounds, His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) Amply have merited of me, of all Th' infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore Triumphal with triumphal act have met, Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease To my associate Powers, them to acquaint With these successes, and with them rejoyce, You two this way, among these numerous Orbs All yours, right down to Paradise descend; There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth Dominion exercise and in the Aire, Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. My Substitutes I send ye, and Create Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. If your joynt power prevailes, th' affaires of Hell No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed Thir course through thickest Constellations held Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, And all about found desolate; for those Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, Flown to the upper World; the rest were all Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls Of Pandaemonium, Citie and proud seate Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand In Council sate, sollicitous what chance Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee Departing gave command, and they observ'd. As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer from the search Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, In shew Plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order, past; and from the dore Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible Ascended his high Throne, which under state Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while He sate, and round about him saw unseen: At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, Rais'd from thir Dark Divan, and with like joy Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand Silence, and with these words attention won. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, For in possession such, not onely of right, I call ye and declare ye now, returnd Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth Triumphant out of this infernal Pit Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven Little inferiour, by my adventure hard With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine Voyag'd th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep Of horrible confusion, over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd To expedite your glorious march; but I Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd My journey strange, with clamorous uproare Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found The new created World, which fame in Heav'n Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection, therein Man Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile Made happie; Him by fraud I have seduc'd From his Creator, and the more to increase Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up Both his beloved Man and all his World, To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, Without our hazard, labour, or allarme, To range in, and to dwell, and over Man To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, Is enmity, which he will put between Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: A World who would not purchase with a bruise, Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods, But up and enter now into full bliss. So having said, a while he stood, expecting Thir universal shout and high applause To fill his eare, when contrary he hears On all sides, from innumerable tongues A dismal universal hiss, the sound Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining Each other, till supplanted down he fell A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, According to his doom: he would have spoke, But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd Alike, to Serpents all as accessories To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now With complicated monsters head and taile, Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, And Dipsas (not so thick swarm'd once the Soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd Above the rest still to retain; they all Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, Where all yet left of that revolted Rout Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, Sublime with expectation when to see ln Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, His will who reigns above, to aggravate Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining For one forbidden Tree a multitude Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; This more delusive, not the touch, but taste Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws With soot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell Into the same illusion, not as Man Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number'd days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. However some tradition they dispers'd Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, Once actual, now in body, and to dwell Habitual habitant; behind her Death Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd With travail difficult, not better farr Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, There best, where most with ravin I may meet; Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, No homely morsels, and whatever thing The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, Till I in Man residing through the Race, His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, And season him thy last and sweetest prey. This said, they both betook them several wayes, Both to destroy, or unimmortal make All kinds, and for destruction to mature Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance To waste and havoc yonder World, which I So fair and good created, and had still Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man Let in these wastful Furies, who impute Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell And his Adherents, that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heav'nly, and conniving-seem To gratifie my scornful Enemies, That laugh, as if transported with some fit Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, At random yielded up to their misrule; And know not that I call'd and drew them thither My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. He ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, While the Creator calling forth by name His mightie Angels gave them several charge, As sorted best with present things. The Sun Had first his precept so to move, so shine, As might affect the Earth with cold and heat Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five Thir planetarie motions and aspects In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt Thir influence malignant when to showre, Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set Thir corners, when with bluster to confound Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, Equal in Days and Nights, except to those Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun To recompence his distance, in thir sight Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow From cold Estotiland, and South as farr Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd His course intended; else how had the World Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; With adverse blast upturns them from the South Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, Sirocco, and Libecchio, Thus began Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle, And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim Glar'd on him passing: these were from without The growing miseries, which Adam saw Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. O miserable of happie! is this the end Of this new glorious World, and mee so late The Glory of that Glory, who now becom Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face Of God, whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness: yet well, if here would end The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare My own deservings; but this will not serve; All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, Is propagated curse. O voice once heard Delightfully, Encrease and multiply, Now death to heare! for what can I encrease Or multiplie, but curses on my head? Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling The evil on him brought by me, will curse My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks Shall be the execration; so besides Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, On mee as on thir natural center light Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee From darkness to promote me, or here place In this delicious Garden? as my Will Concurd not to my being, it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust, Desirous to resigne, and render back All I receav'd, unable to performe Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold The good I sought not. To the loss of that, Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added The sense of endless woes? inexplicable Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, I thus contest; then should have been refusd Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, Then cavil the conditions? and though God Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, But Natural necessity begot. God made thee of choice his own, and of his own To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: O welcom hour whenever! why delayes His hand to execute what his Decree Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth Insensible, how glad would lay me down As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse To mee and to my ofspring would torment me With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, Or in some other dismal place who knows But I shall die a living Death? O thought Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. All of me then shall die: let this appease The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. For though the Lord of all be infinite, Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? Can he make deathless Death? that were to make Strange contradiction, which to God himself Impossible is held, as Argument Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, For angers sake, finite to infinite In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour Satisfi'd never; that were to extend His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, By which all Causes else according still To the reception of thir matter act, Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, Bereaving sense, but endless miserie From this day onward, which 1 feel begun Both in me, and without me, and so last To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution On my defensless head; both Death and I Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, Nor I on my part single, in mee all Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! So disinherited how would ye bless Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, If guiltless? But from me what can proceed, But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, Not to do onely, but to will the same With me? how can they then acquitted stand In sight of God? Him after all Disputes Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain, And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still But to my own conviction: first and last On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support That burden heavier then the Earth to bear Then all the World much heavier, though divided With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future, To Satan only like both crime and doom. O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! Thus Adam to himself lamented loud Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell, Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, Which to his evil Conscience represented All things with double terror: On the Ground Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd Of tardie execution, since denounc't The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, With other echo late I taught your Shades To answer, and resound farr other Song. Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve bebeld, Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee I had persisted happie, had not thy pride And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd Not to be trusted, longing to be seen Though by the Devil himself, him overweening To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, And understood not all was but a shew Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, More to the part sinister from me drawn, Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie To my just number found. O why did God, Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n With Spirits Masculine, create at last This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect Of Nature, and not fill the World at once With Men as Angels without Feminine, Or find some other way to generate Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, And more that shall befall, innumerable Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either He never shall find out fit Mate, but such As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perversness, but shall see her gaind By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld By Parents, or his happiest choice too late Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: Which infinite calamitie shall cause To Humane life, and houshold peace confound. He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, And tresses all disorderd, at his feet Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n What love sincere, and reverence in my heart I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou Against God onely, I against God and thee, And to the place of judgment will return, There with my cries importune Heaven, that all The sentence from thy head remov'd may light On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, Mee mee onely just object of his ire. She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught Commiseration; soon his heart relented Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, Now at his feet submissive in distress, Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st The punishment all on thy self; alas, Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers Could alter high Decrees, I to that place Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, That on my head all might be visited, Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, To me committed and by me expos'd. But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive In offices of Love, how we may light'n Each others burden in our share of woe; Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, A long days dying to augment our paine, And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. Adam, by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can finde, Found so erroneous, thence by just event Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart Living or dying, from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, Tending to some relief of our extremes, Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, As in our evils, and of easier choice. If care of our descent perplex us most, Which must be born to certain woe, devourd By Death at last, and miserable it is To be to others cause of misery, Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring Into this cursed World a woful Race, That after wretched Life must be at last Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. Childless thou art, Childless remaine: so Death Shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. But if thou judge it hard and difficult, Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet, And with desire to languish without hope, Before the present object languishing With like desire, which would be meserie And torment less then none of what we dread, Then both our selves and Seed at once to free From what we fear for both, let us make short, Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply With our own hands his Office on our selves; Why stand we longer shivering under feares, That shew no end but Death, and have the power, Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, Destruction with destruction to destroy. She ended heer, or vehement despaire Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, To better hopes his more attentive minde Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems To argue in thee somthing more sublime And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes That excellence thought in thee, and implies, Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. Or if thou covet death, as utmost end Of miserie, so thinking to evade The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine We are by doom to pay; rather such acts Of contumacie will provoke the highest To make death in us live: Then let us seek Some safer resolution, which methinks I have in view, calling to minde with heed Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd Against us this deceit: to crush his head Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost By death brought on our selves, or childless days Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee Instead shall double ours upon our heads. No more be mention'd then of violence Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, Reluctance against God and his just yoke Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected Immediate dissolution, which we thought Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy, Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; My labour will sustain me; and least Cold Or Heat should injure us, his timely care Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd; How much more, if we pray him, will his ear Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, And teach us further by what means to shun Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, Which now the Skie with various Face begins To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams Reflected, may with matter sere foment, Or by collision of two bodies grinde The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, And sends a comfortable heat from farr, Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, And what may else be remedie or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace Beseeching him, so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd By him with many comforts, till we end In dust, our final rest and native home. What better can we do, then to the place Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall Before him reverent, and there confess Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek. Undoubtedly he will relent and turn From his displeasure; in whose look serene, When angry most he seem'd and most severe, What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell Before him reverent, and both confess'd Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.",John Milton,Fear
The Knife Wearer,"This morning we found ourselves skinning a deer,cutting meat, hanging some to dry and packagingsome for the freezer. It was the dogs late last night that set off a howling, the unexpected smell of freshblood floating down the block, then a familiar carhorn honking in the driveway. My nephew and his friends were hunting and brought us a deer. Motheralways said, “Cut up the meat right away, don’t letit sit.” I look at a front quarter, a hole filled with coagulated blood. Grandma says not to eat the partnext to the wound, “Cut it out; offer it to the earth forhealing, a sacrifice to remember the hungering spirits.” Auntie says to save the muscle along the back strap,“It makes good thread.” I carefully learned the exactplace to cut the joints so the bones separate easily. Mother said that is important—“It means you are athoughtful person.” Auntie is at the door waiting fora roast. “An elder takes the first piece,” she reminded. Mom tells me to save the hooves for her. She wantsto make a bone game for the new grandchild, wantshim to be patient and skillful. I boil the hoofs with sage, find the little toe-bones for her. My hands beginto ache from the work, I soak them in warm waterand start again. I admire the placement of tendons on the deer shoulders, no joints, just the crisscrossingof muscle. Grandma says, “That’s why your dad calledthem jumpers, they bounce off the strength of their flexing muscles.” Late at night Mom helps me stakeout the hide. My back hurts; my feet feel like I’vebeen walking on rocks all day. I want to complain, but Mom catches the look in my eyes. She says to me,“When you get dressed for the dance this weekend,you will proudly wear your beautiful beaded dress, your beaded leggings and moccasins, and last, but notleast, you will put on your beaded belt, and attachedyou will wear your sharp knife and quilled knife sheath because of what you have done this day.”",Lois Red Elk,Fear

What quail-like giant tail of   promises, pleiades, psalters, plane-trees,   what parapets petalling-forth the invisible   into the world of things,turning the list into its spatial form at last,into its archival many-headed, many-legged colony....   Oh look at you.What is it you hold back? What piece of time is it the list   won’t cover?   You down there, in the theater of   operations—you, throat of the world—so diacritical—(are we all waiting for the phone to ring?)—(what will you say? are you home? are you expected soon?)—oh wanderer back from break, all your attention focused—as if the thinking were an oar, this ship the last of some   original fleet, the captains gone but some of us   who saw the plan drawn outstill here—who saw the thinking clot-up in the bodies of the greater men,who saw them sit in silence while the voices in the other roomlit up with passion, itchings, dreams of landings,   while the solitary ones,heads in their hands, so still,the idea barely formingat the base of that stillness,the idea like a homesickness starting just to fold and pleat and knot                                                                                              itselfout of the manyness—the plan—before it’s thought,   before it’s a done deal or the name-you’re-known-by—the men of x, the outcomes of y—before—the mind still gripped hard by the handsthat would hold the skull even stiller if they could,that nothing distract, that nothing but the possible be let                                                          to filter through—the possible and then the finely filamented hope, the filigree,   without the distractions of wonder—oh tiny golden spore just filtering in to touch the good idea,   which taking-form begins to twist,coursing for bottom-footing, palpating for edge-hold, limit,   now finally about torise, about to go into the other room—and yetnot having done so yet, not yet—theintake—before the credo, before the plan—right at the homesickness—before this list you hold   in your exhausted hand.

Bakersfield, Calif July 9, 1961Dear Pinon,       Sorry I haven’t wrote to you sooner but glad to hear that you are well and enjoying Paris.       I got your fathers day wire in the hospital where I put in about twelve days but I am very well now. I quit the ciggeretts but went through ten days of hell quitting and my back had been giving me hell.       It had been very hot here but the last few days has been very nice. Emily just got out of the hospital yesterday. She had her feet worked on. I guess she will tell you about it. Glad to hear you are learning some French.       We are just about through with potatoes. Crop was very good but no price at all which made it a poor year. Cattle are cheap too. It look like a bad year for all farmer’s.       I don’t know anything else to tell you. Take care of your self and enjoy it. Maybe you will never have another chance for another trip. I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance to go, so if you run into a extra special gal between 28 & 35 send her over here to me as all I know over here don’t amount to mutch. Well I guess I’ll close now as I am going over to see Emily.       Hoping to hear from you right away.       This address is 4019 Eton St. be sure and get it straight. Myrtle would like to know how much that watch amounts to. Let us know          Will close now and write soon.                                                    Love ‘Shank’P.S. Excuse this writing as its about 30 years since I wrote a letter.VIIHow can I say this?                              I think my psychiatrist   likes me: he knowsthe most terrible things I’ve done, every stupidity,   inadequacy, awkwardness,ignorance, the mad girl I screwedbecause she once again and againteased and rejected me, and whose psychic incompetence   I grimly greeted as an occasion for revenge;   he greets my voicewith an interest, and regard, and affection,   which seem to signal I’m worth love;—you finallyforgave me for being your son, and in the nasty   shambles of your life, in which you had less and less   occasion for pride, you were proudof me, the first Bidartwho ever got a B.A.; Harvard, despiteyour distrust, was the crown;—but the way   you eyed me:                   the bewilderment, unease:the somehow alwaystentative, suspended judgment ...—however much you tried (and, clearly,   you did try)                   you could not remake your   taste, and like me: could not remake   yourself, to give methe graceneeded to look in a mirror, as I often can   now, with some equanimity ...VIIIWhen did I begin to substitute   insight, for prayer? ...                                     —You believed in neither:   but said, “My life is over,”after you had married Shirley,twenty-five years younger, with threesmall children, the youngestsix months old; she was unfaithfulwithin two months, the marriage was simply   annulled ...                   A diabetic, you didn’ttake your insulin when you drank, andalmost managed to diemany times ...                      You punished Ruthwhen she went to Los Angeles for a weekend, by   beginning to drink; she would return home   either to find you in the hospital,or in a coma on the floor ...                                             The exacerbation   of this seeming necessityfor connection—;                         you and mother taught me   there’s little that’s redemptive or usefulin natural affections ...I must unlearn; I must believeyou were merely a manwith a character, and a past—;                                              you wore them,                                                 unexamined,like a nimbus offuriesround yourgreying, awesome head ...IXWhat should I have done? In 1963,you wanted to borrow ten thousand dollars   from me, so that we could buy cattle   together, under the name “Bidart and Son,”—most of your money was tied up   in the increasingly noxious “Bidart Brothers,”   run by your brother, Johnny ...I said no,that I wanted to use the moneyfor graduate school; but I thoughtif you went on a binge, and as had happened   before, simply threw it away ...The Bidarts agreedyou were not to be trusted; you accepted   my answer, with an airof inevitability I was shocked at ...I didn’t want to see your self-disgust;   —somehow, your self-congratulation   had eroded more deeply, muchmore deeply, than even I had wished,—but for years, how I had wished! ...I have a friend who saysthat he has never felt a conflictbetween something deeply wished or desired,   and what he thought was “moral” ...Father, such innocencesurely is a kind of Eden—; but,somehow, I can’t regret that weare banished from that company—;   in the awareness, thehistory of our contradictions and violence,   insofar as I am “moral” at all,is the beginning of my moral being.XWhen I began this poem,                                    to see myselfas a piece of history, having a pastwhich shapes, and informs, and thus inevitably   limits—          at first this seemed sufficient, the beginning of   freedom ...                  The way to approach freedomwas to acknowledge necessity:—   I sensed I had to become not merelya speaker, the “eye,” but a character ...And you had to become a character: with a past,   with a set of internal contradictions and necessities   which if I could once define, would at least   begin to release us from each other ...But, of course, no such knowledge is possible;—   as I touch your photographs, they stare back at me   with the dazzling, impenetrable, glitter of mere life ...You stand smiling, at the end of the twenties,   in a suit, and hat,cane and spats, with a collie at your feet,   happy to be handsome, dashing, elegant:—   and though I cannot connect this imagewith the end of your life, with the defensive   gnarled would-be cowboy,—   you seem happy at that fact, happyto be surprising; unknowable; unpossessable ...You say it’s what you always understood by freedom. 1968-69.",Frank Bidart,Fear

Lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-leads, Which long to nuzzle in the hearts of lads, Or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth Sharp with the sharpness of grief and death. For his teeth seem for laughing round an apple. There lurk no claws behind his fingers supple; And God will grow no talons at his heels, Nor antlers through the thickness of his curls.",Wilfred Owen,Fear
My Life as a Subject,"I Because I was born in a kingdom, there was a king. At times the king was a despot; at other times, not. Axes flashed in the road at night, but if you closed your eyes and sang the old ballads sitting on the well edge amongst your kinspeople then the silver did not appear to be broken.    Such were the circumstances. They made a liar out of me. Did they change my spirit?  Kith in the night  the sound of owls. A bird fight. II We also had a queen, whetted by the moon. And we her subjects, softening in her sight. III What one had  the other had to have too. Soon  parrots bloomed in every garden, and  every daughter had a tuning fork  jeweled with emeralds. IV Learning to hunt in the new empire, the king invited his subjects to send him their knives. He tested these knives on oranges, pomegranates, acorn squash, soft birches, stillborns, prisoners who had broken rules. He used them on the teeth of traitors. V When strangers massed at the borders, the courtiers practiced  subjection of the foreign. The court  held a procession  of twine, rope, gold, knife, light, and prostitutes with their vials of white powder. Smoke coursed into the courtyard, and we wrought hunger upon the bodies of strangers. I am sure you can imagine it, really what need  is there for me to tell you? You were a stranger once too, and I brought rope. VI Afterward, I always slept, and let the dealers  come to me alone with jewels. VII  In the court at night, we debated the skin of language, questioned what might one day be revealed inside: a pink and soft fruit, a woman in a field. . . Or a shadow, sticky and loose as old jam. Our own  dialect was abstract, we wished to understand not how things were but what spectacle we might  make from them. VIII One day a merchant brought moving pictures,  the emperor's new delight.  He tacked dark cloth to all  the windows, top  and bottom, and turned the lights off, cranking the machine like a needle and thread making forms into which we could insinuate our cold bodies and find warmth. Light; dark. And the sliding images of courtiers merrily balancing pineapples on their heads, as if this  were an adequate story. IX And our queen, that hidden self. What became of her? Slid into the night like a statue, and felt around into shadows, nothing to prove, all worldly latitudes, knowing as a spider in retreat. The web her mind, and in it, the fly. X On Sundays, we flew kites  to ensure our joy was seen by all those who  threatened to threaten us. The thread spooling out up high  in the purple sky and silver gelatin films being made, sliding through the cranking machine so that the barbarians could know we made images of ourselves coated in precious metal and sent them away indifferent to our wealth. I miss the citrus  smell of spring on the plaza filled with young and long-limbed kite flyers. XI Do I have anything else to add? Only that I obeyed my king, my kind, I was not faithless. Should I be punished for that? It is true  some of my pictures creak unhappily through the spindle. It is true one day they came to my house. I know  the powder we coated our fingers with made us thirsty and sometimes cruel. But I was born with a spirit like you. I have woken, you see, and I wish to be  made new.",Meghan O'Rourke,Anger
I Flew into Denver April,I flew into Denver April.Rock salt and sand peppered the asphaltreflecting myself on a downtown streetwhere I’d paused on my route to smell lilacs.The wanton winds chortled wickedlyover remnant snows in gray clumps of doomand my heart soared gladly at winter’s deathbut an hour later I had whiskey breathat a dead end bar full of Indians.A Winnebago woman waltzed with meand told me how handsome I truly wasso I bought her drinks and felt her hipsand somewhere between the grindsand dips she lifted my wallet and split.,Adrian C.

The Small Hours,"A joyrider rips up Lockland. It takes barely five minutes   for a precinct helicopter to dip and swivel over lawns   and two opposing lines of cars   parked innocently snug to the sidewalk.   They haven't found him yet.   Every couple of minutes or so,   my blind soaks in outrageous light   and the helicopter hauls its drone and feud all over my backyard.   There's a fan over my bed that says similar things in summer: adages, reproach and rhetoric. I talk too much; give far too much away. In mumbling my company, I reckon on a twofold payoff: some echo; being found out, consequence. I lie low. Minutes swell.   He must be out there somewhere,   lights switched off, crouched and bundled, foot within an inch of the get-go.   I pull the comforter up over my ears, count to forty-two, then start over.   I'm trying, trying hard, to hold my breath.",Vona Groarke,Anger
Making Peace,"A voice from the dark called out,             ‘The poets must give usimagination of peace, to oust the intense, familiarimagination of disaster. Peace, not onlythe absence of war.’                                   But peace, like a poem,is not there ahead of itself,can’t be imagined before it is made,can’t be known exceptin the words of its making,grammar of justice,syntax of mutual aid.                                       A feeling towards it,dimly sensing a rhythm, is all we haveuntil we begin to utter its metaphors,learning them as we speak.                                              A line of peace might appearif we restructured the sentence our lives are making,revoked its reaffirmation of profit and power,questioned our needs, allowedlong pauses . . .                        A cadence of peace might balance its weighton that different fulcrum; peace, a presence,an energy field more intense than war,might pulse then,stanza by stanza into the world,each act of livingone of its words, each worda vibration of light—facetsof the forming crystal.",Denise Levertov,Joy
The Rainbow,"Soft falls the shower, the thunders cease!And see the messenger of peace   Illumes the eastern skies;Blest sign of firm unchanging love!While others seek the cause to prove,   That bids thy beauties rise.My soul, content with humbler views,Well pleased admires thy varied hues,   And can with joy beholdThy beauteous form, and wondering gazeEnraptured on thy mingled rays   Of purple, green, and gold.Enough for me to deem divineThe hand that paints each glowing line;   To think that thou art givenA transient gleam of that bright placeWhere Beauty owns celestial grace,   A faint display of Heaven!",Charlotte Richardson,Joy
Memorabilia,"Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,   And did he stop and speak to you?And did you speak to him again?   How strange it seems, and new! But you were living before that,   And you are living after,And the memory I started at—   My starting moves your laughter! I crossed a moor, with a name of its own   And a certain use in the world no doubt,Yet a hand's-breadth of it shines alone   'Mid the blank miles round about: For there I picked up on the heather   And there I put inside my breastA moulted feather, an eagle-feather—   Well, I forget the rest.",Robert Browning,Fear
The Graves,"So here are the strange feelings that flickerin you or anchor like weights in your eyes.Turn back and you might undo them,the way trees seem to floatfree of themselves as they root.A swan can hold itself on the gray ice waterand not waver, an open note upon which minor chordsblur and rest. But it was born dark.The shore of that lake is littered with glass.How you came to be who you arewas all unwinding, aimless on a bike,off to retrieve a parcel that could only be a gift,and felt, as a child, the seaweave around your feet, white light rushing in with the surf.What lived there?                               —Joy, dispatched from nowhere,and no need to think about your purpose,and no fear that the sun gliding downmight burn the earth it feeds. Black habitat of nowin which decimation looks tender.Sometimes the call of a bird is so clearit bruises my hands. At night, behind glass,light empties out then fills a room and the people in it,hovering around a fire, gorgeous shapes of windleaning close to each other in laughter.From this distance, they are a grace,an ache.

shotgunLetting him have itNow the moon was a fifty-cent pieceIt was a belly I wanted      to cut openWhen the flies got badI kept the hand in the smokehouseV   Swimming at NightThe midget ran his finger across his neckThe other one said “Give it back”I waited in the outhouseI had a sawed-off shotgunThe men rode offIn the afternoon they sold fishThey cleaned them at the pumpThe scales dried up

to sleep withI called the knife the Holy GhostTo make me go crazyI took all my clothes offAnd jumped down the hole in the outhouseI grabbed the yellow jacket nestAnd held it over my heartI pumped cold water over myselfAnd wallowed in the mudI walked through the snake den barefootedI swam the river at midnightWith the hand and a blue feather in my mouthAnd the Holy Ghost around my neckAnd the hooks caught in my arms    they caught in my legsI cut the trot lines in twoI saw the guitar player stealing the fishI was swimming beneath the shackUnder the sleeping midgetWith the fish bandit’s hand in my mouthI climbed through the trap doorI crawled under the bedI cut the hooks outI believe I was snake bitI put the hand in the slop jarI reached up and tickled his nose with the featherHe got out of bedHe turned the lights onHe let down his pantsHe reached under the bed for the slop jarHe took the lid offHe screamedI brought the knife across his legI hamstrung the midgetI swam under the waterWith the hand in my mouthI came up near the guitar player’s boatHe was running the linesI swam to the other end of the trot lineI put the hand on a hookI jerked the lines like a big fishThe guitar player worked his way downHe thought he had a good oneI let go of the lineHe saw his left handHe screamedHe fell out of the boatI swam back through the riverI buried the knife in the leveeI was sleeping in

The Relics,"1. brett returns my mother to the wildernessI slipped them into my friend’s palm — the tiny crucifix, and dove,from off my mother’s pendant watch — and I asked her to walk them up through the brushtoward timberline, and find a placeto hurl them, for safekeeping. Now,she writes, “I walked up the canyon at dusk,warm, with a touch of fall blowing down the canyon,came to an outcrop, above a steepdrop — far below, a seasonalcreek, green willows. I stood on a boulderand held out my hand. I wished your mother all thelove in the world, and I sent the talismansflying off the cliff. They were so small,and the wind was blowing, so I never saw orheard them land.” My mother is whereI cannot find her, she is gone beyondrecall, she lies in her sterling shapeslight as the most weightless bone in the body, herstirrup bone, which was ground upand sown into the sea. I do not knowwhat a soul is, I think of itas the smallest, the core, civil right. And sheis wild now with it, she touches and istouched by no one knows — down, ordroppings of a common nighthawk,root of bird’s foot fern, antenna ofHairstreak or Echo Azure, or stepped on by thehuge translucent Jerusalem cricket. There wassomething deeply right aboutthe physical elements — atoms, and cells,and marrow — of my mother’s body,when I was young, and now her delicateinsignias receive the directtouch of the sun, and scatter it,unseen, all over her home.  2. cross and dove  I had not wanted them, and I hadn’t knownwhat to do with them, the minusculesymbols of my mother’s religion,I looked for a crack in the stone floor of thecathedral but could not find one. Then I thoughtof the wilderness near Desolation,and asked my friend to carry them upto a peak of granite, and let the wind take them. Sincethen, it has been as if my mother’sspirit matter has been returnedinto the great bank of matter,as her marrow had been sifted down intothe ocean. It doesn’t matter, now, if Iever wanted to disassemblemy mother. The sixteenth-of-an-inch-across cross, and the silver line drawingof a dove are cached, somewhere, that is nowhereto be found. Now I think of the nature of metal, and howlong the soul-dolls of her trust will last in theirspider-egg-sac of roots, needles,quartz, feathers, dust, snow, shedclaw. Her belief she would have an eternallife was absolute, I think.It would not be good to think of my motherwithout her God — like a hermit howling in themoonscape of a desert. Once, when she was old — like anexquisite child playing a cronein the school play — we talked about heaven.She wasn’t sure exactly how, but sheknew her father would be there, and her elderbrother, and her second husband —maybe it was a heaven for four,the three men and her. It was soeasy to make my mother happyin her last years, to tell her that Icould just see her, as a kitten, in God’slap, being petted. Her eyes sparkled with morebeams than any other eyes I have seen.I have sent the tokens of her everlasting beinginto the high altitude.They will shine long after I can sing her — sing what Iperceived through the distorted prisms of my vision.I don’t know if I saw my motheror did not see her.

Eros Turannos,"She fears him, and will always ask    What fated her to choose him; She meets in his engaging mask                      All reasons to refuse him; But what she meets and what she fears Are less than are the downward years, Drawn slowly to the foamless weirs    Of age, were she to lose him. Between a blurred sagacity    That once had power to sound him, And Love, that will not let him be    The Judas that she found him, Her pride assuages her almost, As if it were alone the cost.— He sees that he will not be lost,    And waits and looks around him. A sense of ocean and old trees    Envelops and allures him; Tradition, touching all he sees    Beguiles and reassures him; And all her doubts of what he says Are dimmed with what she knows of days— Till even prejudice delays    And fades, and she secures him. The falling leaf inaugurates    The reign of her confusion; The pounding wave reverberates    The dirge of her illusion; And home, where passion lived and died, Becomes a place where she can hide, While all the town and harbor side    Vibrate with her seclusion. We tell you, tapping on our brows,    The story as it should be,— As if the story of a house    Were told, or ever could be; We’ll have no kindly veil between Her visions and those we have seen,— As if we guessed what hers have been,    Or what they are or would be. Meanwhile we do no harm; for they    That with a god have striven, Not hearing much of what we say,    Take what the god has given; Though like waves breaking it may be, Or like a changed familiar tree, Or like a stairway to the sea    Where down the blind are driven.",Edwin Arlington Robinson,Fear

Les Très Riches Heures de Florida,"NONESAt three p.m.under sky coming to harmsomething too red flashes from a limb,so red it hurts:against sky coming apart,against a left-out, twice-soaked shirt,a cardinalinflames the profane cathedralof suburban yard its owner let fallinto disgrace.How rain embarrassesthe half-pruned hedge.

The River of Bees,In a dream I returned to the river of beesFive orange trees by the bridge andBeside two mills my houseInto whose courtyard a blindman followedThe goats and stood singingOf what was olderSoon it will be fifteen yearsHe was old he will have fallen into his eyesI took my eyesA long way to the calendarsRoom after room asking how shall I liveOne of the ends is made of streetsOne man processions carry through itEmpty bottles theirImage of hopeIt was offered to me by nameOnce once and onceIn the same city I was bornAsking what shall I sayHe will have fallen into his mouthMen think they are better than grassI return to his voice rising like a forkful of hayHe was old he is not real nothing is realNor the noise of death drawing waterWe are the echo of the futureOn the door it says what to do to surviveBut we were not born to surviveOnly to live,W.
